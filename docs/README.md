# SquadDash

**A native Windows dashboard for managing AI coding agent teams powered by the Squad CLI.**

SquadDash transforms the Squad AI team system into a visual, interactive experience. Work with multiple specialized agents in parallel, see their activity in real-time, and manage your entire AI development team from one native WPF application.

Note: This documentation is largely AI generated at this point and has not been reviewed.

## What is SquadDash?

SquadDash is a desktop application for Windows that provides:

- **Visual agent management** — See all your agents at a glance with live status cards
- **Multi-agent transcripts** — Open multiple agent conversation panels simultaneously
- **Real-time activity tracking** — Watch tool calls, thinking blocks, and task progress as they happen
- **Team configuration** — Define your AI team in `.squad/team.md` with routing rules in `.squad/routing.md`
- **Integrated documentation** — Browse repo docs in a built-in panel with tree navigation and markdown rendering
- **Voice input** — Push-to-talk (double-Ctrl) for hands-free prompt entry using Azure Speech
- **Workspace-aware** — Automatically installs Squad CLI per-workspace, tracks installation state

---

## Why SquadDash?

The Squad CLI is powerful but command-line driven. SquadDash brings:

- **Discoverability** — Hover on agent cards to see glowing accent highlights; shift-click to open transcripts
- **Parallel workflows** — Launch multiple agents as background tasks and monitor them all at once
- **Context preservation** — Every agent conversation is persisted, searchable, and resumable across sessions
- **Better debugging** — See every tool call with labeled icons (🔎 grep, ✏️ edit, 👀 view, 🤖 task)
- **Less context switching** — Docs, transcripts, and workspace all in one window
