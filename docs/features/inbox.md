# Inbox Panel

The Inbox panel is an AI-to-user messaging system. Agents send you structured messages — with rich body text, attachments, and optional action buttons — that accumulate in the panel while you work. You can read them at any time, even hours after they were sent.

---

## How Agents Send Messages

Any agent (coordinator or `argus-weld`) can send an inbox message by appending an `INBOX_MESSAGE_JSON` block to the end of its response:

```
INBOX_MESSAGE_JSON:
{
  "subject": "Your subject line here",
  "from": "coordinator",
  "body": "Full **Markdown** body text.",
  "attachments": [],
  "actions": []
}
```

SquadDash detects the block, persists it to `.squad/inbox/`, and immediately updates the Inbox panel.

> **Agent guidance:** The `INBOX_MESSAGE_JSON` block must appear at the very end of the response. Everything after the opening `{` until the closing `}` is parsed as JSON.

---

## The Inbox Panel

The panel appears in the left sidebar.

- **Unread badge** — a count bubble on the panel header shows how many unread messages are waiting.
- **Message list** — messages are listed in arrival order, each showing the sender handle and subject line.
- **Click to open** — clicking any message opens the **message popup** showing the full body, attachments, and action buttons.
- **Read/unread state** — a message is marked read the first time you open it; unread messages are visually distinguished in the list.

## Message Fields

| Field | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `subject` | yes | Plain-text subject line shown in the panel list and popup header |
| `from` | yes | Sender handle — `"coordinator"` or `"argus-weld"` |
| `body` | yes | Markdown content rendered in the popup |
| `attachments` | no | Array of typed attachment objects (see below) |
| `actions` | no | Array of deferred quick-reply buttons (see below) |

---

## Attachments

Each attachment has a `type` field that controls how it is displayed and what happens when you click it.

### `url` — Open a web link

```json
{
  "type": "url",
  "label": "View pull request",
  "href": "https://github.com/org/repo/pull/42"
}
```

Clicking opens the URL in your default browser.

---

### `file` — Open a local file

```json
{
  "type": "file",
  "label": "See migration guide",
  "path": "docs/migration.md"
}
```

Clicking opens the file. `.md` files open in the built-in Markdown viewer; all other files open with the system's default application.

---

### `image` — View an image

```json
{
  "type": "image",
  "label": "Screenshot",
  "path": "docs/images/before-after.png"
}
```

Clicking opens a lightweight image viewer window. Both local paths and remote URLs (via `href` instead of `path`) are supported.

---

### `task-ref` — Link to a task

```json
{
  "type": "task-ref",
  "label": "Flaky CI test",
  "taskId": "fix-ci-flake"
}
```

Clicking shows a popup with the task's current status, priority, owner, and description, read live from `.squad/tasks.md`.

---

### `text` — Inline Markdown content

```json
{
  "type": "text",
  "label": "Full diff summary",
  "content": "## Summary\n\nChanged 3 files: `src/A.cs`, `src/B.cs`, `tests/C.cs`."
}
```

Clicking shows the Markdown content in a dialog — useful for longer supplementary text that would clutter the main body.

---

## Action Buttons

The `actions` array renders as clickable buttons in the message popup. Actions are *deferred* — they do nothing until you click them, making them ideal for situations where the agent cannot wait for a real-time reply (for example, during [Maintenance Mode](maintenance-mode.md)).

Each action has:

| Field | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `label` | yes | Button text |
| `routeMode` | yes | `"start_named_agent"`, `"start_coordinator"`, or `"done"` |
| `targetAgent` | for `start_named_agent` | Handle of the agent to route the prompt to |
| `prompt` | for `start_*` modes | Fully self-contained prompt injected when clicked |

### Route modes

| `routeMode` | What happens on click |
|---|---|
| `start_named_agent` | Sends `prompt` to the agent specified by `targetAgent` |
| `start_coordinator` | Sends `prompt` to the coordinator |
| `done` | Dismisses the message popup; no prompt is sent |

> **Self-contained prompts:** Each `prompt` must include all the context needed to act — file paths, symptoms, and any relevant background. There is no conversation history available when the button is clicked; the prompt is the entire briefing.

## Complete Example

The following shows a message using every field and attachment type:

```
INBOX_MESSAGE_JSON:
{
  "subject": "Code smell scan — 3 findings",
  "from": "argus-weld",
  "body": "## Scan Results\n\nI found **3 issues** during the maintenance window. See attachments for details.",
  "attachments": [
    {
      "type": "text",
      "label": "Full findings report",
      "content": "### Finding 1\n`src/Parser.cs:88` — deeply nested conditional (depth 6).\n\n### Finding 2\n`src/Utils.cs:204` — unused private method `BuildCache()`.\n\n### Finding 3\n`tests/ParserTests.cs:31` — test name does not describe expected outcome."
    },
    {
      "type": "file",
      "label": "Open Parser.cs",
      "path": "src/Parser.cs"
    },
    {
      "type": "task-ref",
      "label": "Reduce nesting in Parser",
      "taskId": "refactor-parser-nesting"
    },
    {
      "type": "image",
      "label": "Complexity heatmap",
      "path": "docs/images/complexity-heatmap.png"
    },
    {
      "type": "url",
      "label": "Cyclomatic complexity reference",
      "href": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclomatic_complexity"
    }
  ],
  "actions": [
    {
      "label": "Fix Parser.cs now",
      "routeMode": "start_named_agent",
      "targetAgent": "arjun-sen",
      "prompt": "Arjun: during a maintenance scan on 2026-05-22 I found deeply nested conditionals (depth 6) in src/Parser.cs starting at line 88. Please refactor to reduce nesting to at most depth 3. Preserve existing behaviour and keep all tests passing."
    },
    {
      "label": "Add to backlog",
      "routeMode": "start_coordinator",
      "prompt": "Add a mid-priority task to address 3 code-smell findings from the 2026-05-22 maintenance scan: (1) deeply nested conditional in src/Parser.cs:88, (2) unused method BuildCache() in src/Utils.cs:204, (3) non-descriptive test name in tests/ParserTests.cs:31."
    },
    {
      "label": "Dismiss",
      "routeMode": "done"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Storage

Messages are persisted as JSON files in `.squad/inbox/` inside your workspace directory:

```
.squad/inbox/{timestamp}-{id}.json
```

Files are written when the message is received and read back each time SquadDash opens, so your inbox survives restarts.
