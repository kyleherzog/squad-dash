# Prompt Queue

When you submit a prompt while an agent is still running, it doesn't get lost — it enters the **Prompt Queue**. Queued prompts wait their turn and dispatch automatically when the current agent turn completes.

---

## How the Queue Works

1. You type a prompt and press Send while the agent is mid-run.
2. The prompt enters the queue instead of interrupting the running turn.
3. When the current turn finishes, the first queued prompt dispatches automatically.
4. The cycle repeats until the queue is empty.

## Queue Tabs

Each queued item appears as a numbered tab: **#1**, **#2**, and so on.

- Click a tab to view and **edit** the queued prompt before it dispatches.
- Edits are applied when the item eventually runs — you can refine a queued prompt at any time before its turn.
- Tabs are removed as items dispatch.

## Editing a Queued Prompt

Click any queue tab to open the prompt text for that item. Edit freely — the change takes effect when that item reaches the front of the queue.

## Pausing the Queue: `[[AWAITING_INPUT]]`

If the agent outputs `[[AWAITING_INPUT]]`, the queue **pauses**. Queued prompts will not dispatch until the user explicitly responds to the agent.

This allows agents to ask clarifying questions mid-conversation without the queue steamrolling past them.

Once you reply, the queue resumes and dispatches the next item normally.

---

## Pausing Auto-Resume at Startup (Shift key)

If SquadDash closed while items were still in the queue, it normally re-dispatches them automatically on the next launch. To suppress this, **hold either Shift key while SquadDash is starting up** (at the moment the window loads).

- The Shift state is read once — releasing Shift after the window appears has no effect.
- If queue auto-dispatch was suppressed, the transcript shows: `⏸ Startup paused — Shift was held. Queue and loop auto-resume suppressed.`
- The queued items remain in place; you can review or edit them before dispatching manually.

This is useful when you want to inspect or revise queued prompts before they run rather than having them fire immediately on startup.

## Voice Dictation and the Queue

If a prompt was dictated by voice, the queue tab shows **clean text only** — the voice annotation (`some or all of this prompt was dictated by voice`) is not visible while the item is waiting in the queue.

The annotation appears in the **transcript** only after the item dispatches and the turn completes.

See **[Voice Input](voice-input.md)** for details on the voice annotation.

## Queue Behaviour at a Glance

| Scenario | Result |
|---|---|
| Prompt submitted while agent running | Enters queue as next tab |
| Agent turn completes | First queued item dispatches automatically |
| Agent outputs `[[AWAITING_INPUT]]` | Queue pauses; resumes after user responds |
| Edit a queued tab | Changes apply when that item dispatches |
| Voice-dictated queued prompt | Tab shows clean text; annotation added after dispatch |
| Shift held at startup | Queue auto-dispatch suppressed; items remain for manual review |
