# Squad Decisions

## Active Decisions

---

### 2026-05-21 — All `.md` files open in the internal MarkdownDocumentWindow editor

**Decision:**

> Whenever SquadDash opens a Markdown file — whether it is a charter file, a notes file, `maintenance.md`, `tasks.md`, `decisions.md`, or any other `.md` file — it **must** open it in the internal `MarkdownDocumentWindow` editor.  
> Opening `.md` files via `Process.Start` / `UseShellExecute = true` (which would fall through to Notepad or the OS default) is **never** acceptable.

**Rationale:** The internal editor provides syntax rendering, "Add to Chat", "Add to Notes", and AI revision capabilities. Bypassing it degrades the experience and breaks the consistent UX contract.

**Implementation pattern:**

```csharp
MarkdownDocumentWindow.Show(
    CanShowOwnedWindow() ? this : null,
    title,
    filePath,
    showSource: true,
    BuildMarkdownCaptureContext());
```

If the call site is inside a panel controller (not `MainWindow`), pass an `Action<string> openInMarkdownEditor` callback from `MainWindow` via the controller constructor, and call that instead of `Process.Start`.

### 2026-05-18 — Process rule: never silently defer spec requirements without a visible checkpoint

**Context:** During the Preferences grouped-TreeView implementation, the original spec called for splitting the Speech page into three separate pages: **Provider**, **Push to Talk**, and **Text Replacements**. The implementing agent deferred this split as a "later task" without flagging it visibly or offering a quick-reply choice to the user. The user noticed, and was rightly unhappy: the deferral was invisible and violated the spec without consent.

**Decision:**

> **Agents must never silently defer a requirement from the user's original spec.** If a full implementation is judged impractical in a single pass (e.g., it would substantially increase scope beyond the current task), the agent MUST:
>
> 1. **Implement everything it can** within the current task.
> 2. **Clearly state** what was deferred and why, in the visible response — not buried in a report.
> 3. **Report the deferral back to the Coordinator** in the agent's result summary, with a suggested quick-reply label and target agent.
>
> The **Coordinator** is solely responsible for deciding whether to surface a quick-reply button to the user. Launched agents do not emit `QUICK_REPLIES_JSON` — only the Coordinator does. An agent that deferred work communicates that to the Coordinator; the Coordinator reads the summary, states the deferral visibly in its own response, and offers the quick reply.
>
> Example correct phrasing (from Coordinator): *"✅ Done. **Note: one spec item was deferred** — the Speech page split (Provider / Push to Talk / Text Replacements) was not yet implemented because [reason]. Click below to do it now."*
>
> The quick reply must be actionable (routes to the right agent to complete the deferred item), not just informational.

**Scope:** All agents. Applies to any task where the user has provided a specification (written or spoken) and the agent cannot fully implement it in one pass.

**Why this matters:** Silent deferrals erode trust and create invisible technical debt. A visible, immediately-actionable checkpoint respects the user's intent and keeps them in control of scope decisions.

### 2026-04-30 — `squad cross-squad` integration architecture

**Context:** The task asked how SquadDash should surface cross-workspace agent interactions. `squad cross-squad` does NOT exist as a CLI command in the 0.9.5-insider release. The functionality lives entirely in the `@bradygaster/squad-sdk` module `runtime/cross-squad.js`.

**What cross-squad actually is (SDK investigation findings):**

Cross-squad is a **manifest-based discovery + GitHub issue delegation** system. No real-time agent-to-agent RPC exists. The mechanism is:

1. **Manifest** — each squad can publish `.squad/manifest.json`:
   ```json
   {
     "name": "my-squad",
     "capabilities": ["feature-A", "feature-B"],
     "accepts": ["issues", "prs"],
     "contact": { "repo": "owner/repo" },
     "description": "optional human description"
   }
   ```

2. **Discovery** — other squads find this squad via:
   - `.squad/upstream.json` — lists upstream repos (type: `"local"` with path, or `"git"`)
   - `.squad/squad-registry.json` — flat list `[{ "name": "...", "path": "..." }]`
   - SDK: `discoverSquads(squadDir)` merges upstreams + registry, deduplicates by name

3. **Delegation** — creates a GitHub issue in the target repo:
   - Title gets `[cross-squad]` prefix
   - Labels: `squad:cross-squad` + any caller-supplied labels
   - SDK: `buildDelegationArgs(options)` returns `gh issue create` args; caller executes `gh`

4. **Status** — queries a delegated issue's state:
   - SDK: `buildStatusCheckArgs(issueUrl)` → `gh issue view --repo owner/repo 123 --json state,title`
   - SDK: `parseIssueStatus(jsonOutput, issueUrl)` → `{ url, state: "open"|"closed"|"unknown", title }`

**Current state of this workspace:** No `.squad/manifest.json`, `.squad/upstream.json`, or `.squad/squad-registry.json` exist. This workspace is not yet participating in any cross-squad network.

**Architecture decision:**

SquadDash should support cross-squad in **two phases**, with Phase 1 being the right scope for now:

**Phase 1 — Discovery + status (read-only, no CLI required):**
- Add a `cross_squad_discover` NDJSON bridge request
- Call `discoverSquads(squadDir)` synchronously inside `runPrompt.ts`, emit a `cross_squad_discovered` event with the discovered squads as JSON
- Surface as a "Cross-Squad" menu item under Workspace (similar to SubSquads)
- If no manifest/upstream config exists: show instructional message with the config schema
- If squads are discovered: display name, capabilities, repo, accepts fields, source
- No `gh` CLI execution needed for Phase 1

**Phase 2 — Delegation (requires `gh` CLI, deferred):**
- Add `cross_squad_delegate` bridge request: title, body, targetRepo, labels
- In `runPrompt.ts`: call `buildDelegationArgs(options)`, spawn `gh` with those args, emit `cross_squad_delegated` or `cross_squad_delegate_error`
- Add UI for composing delegation: prompt box pre-filled from selected issue or freeform
- Add status polling: `cross_squad_status_check` request → runs `gh issue view`, emits result
- Deferred because: (a) requires `gh` CLI present, (b) requires auth, (c) UX needs more design

**Rationale for deferring Phase 2:**
- Phase 1 has zero external dependencies — pure SDK file reads, no auth, no network
- Phase 2 delegation creates real GitHub issues — accidental delegation would be hard to undo
- The CLI doesn't expose `squad cross-squad` yet, suggesting the feature isn't polished enough for casual use
- Phase 1 (discovery) gives SquadDash users insight into their cross-squad topology without risk

**Not building now:** Any manifest editor UI or upstream config wizard — these belong to the squad CLI's `squad upstream` commands (`add|remove|list|sync`), which already handle upstream config management.

**Files to create/modify when Phase 1 is implemented:**
- `Squad.SDK/runPrompt.ts`: `CrossSquadDiscoverRequest` type, `handleCrossSquadDiscover()`, dispatch case
- `SquadDash/SquadSdkEvent.cs`: `CrossSquadDiscoveredJson`, `CrossSquadCount` fields
- `SquadDash/SquadSdkProcess.cs`: `SquadSdkCrossSquadDiscoverRequest` record, `DiscoverCrossSquadsAsync()`
- `SquadDash/MainWindow.xaml.cs`: `cross_squad_discovered` event handler, Workspace → "Cross-Squad" menu item

### 2026-05-01 — SubSquads bridge prototype approach

**Context:** The squad CLI 0.9.5-insider replaced `squad streams` with `squad subsquads` (aliases: `workstreams`, `streams`). The API stabilised in `@bradygaster/squad-sdk` which exports `loadSubSquadsConfig(cwd)` and `resolveSubSquad(cwd)`. The CLI only supports `list`, `status`, and `activate <name>` — no create/add/remove subcommands exist.

**Decision:** Wrap `loadSubSquadsConfig` and `resolveSubSquad` in the existing NDJSON bridge via two new request types: `subsquads_list` and `subsquads_activate`. Surface via a "SubSquads" menu item in the Workspace menu that displays config + active state in the transcript.

**Rationale:**
- No new process or shell-out needed — SDK functions are synchronous and imported directly into `runPrompt.ts`.
- Fire-and-forget pattern (same as `rc_start`) keeps the bridge simple.
- `subsquads_activate` writes the `.squad-workstream` file directly, which is the same mechanism used by the CLI.
- Config file is `.squad/workstreams.json` (note: CLI's "not configured" message mistakenly says `streams.json`).

**API notes:**
- Config: `.squad/workstreams.json` — `{ defaultWorkflow, workstreams: [{ name, labelFilter, workflow?, folderScope?, description? }] }`
- Active subsquad resolution order: `SQUAD_TEAM` env var → `.squad-workstream` file → auto-select if exactly one → null
- `resolveSubSquad` returns `{ name, definition, source }` where `source` is `"env"`, `"file"`, or `"config"`

**Implemented:**
- `Squad.SDK/runPrompt.ts`: `handleSubSquadsList`, `handleSubSquadsActivate`, `SubSquadsListRequest`, `SubSquadsActivateRequest` types
- `SquadDash/SquadSdkEvent.cs`: `SubSquadsConfigured`, `SubSquadsCount`, `WorkstreamsJson`, `ActiveSubsquadName`, `ActiveSubsquadSource`, `SubSquadName`
- `SquadDash/SquadSdkProcess.cs`: `SquadSdkSubSquadsListRequest`, `SquadSdkSubSquadsActivateRequest`, `ListSubSquadsAsync`, `ActivateSubSquadAsync`
- `SquadDash/MainWindow.xaml.cs`: event handlers for `subsquads_listed`/`subsquads_activated`/`subsquads_error`; Workspace > SubSquads menu item

### 2026-04-17 — MainWindow decomposition approach

**Context:** `MainWindow.xaml.cs` had grown to 8,305 lines with 71 fields and 20+ distinct responsibility domains. Orion Vale's architectural audit graded it C. The class was a classic god-object: UI event handlers, agent thread lifecycle, background task tracking, PTT state machine, markdown rendering, prompt execution, conversation persistence, and OS/CLI integration all co-located.

**Decision:** Extract into focused helper classes using constructor injection with `Action<>`/`Func<>` delegates. Preserve the existing code-behind pattern — no MVVM migration.

**Rationale:** No ICommand/ViewModel infrastructure exists in the project. Introducing MVVM would multiply the change surface and require a parallel refactor of every data binding and event handler. Plain C# service objects with delegate injection achieve the same structural clarity (single responsibility, testable units) at a fraction of the risk. The `Action<>`/`Func<>` pattern keeps MainWindow as the single owner of all fields; helper classes call back into it for side effects rather than holding copies of state.

**Outcome:** 9 helper classes extracted over one session. MainWindow.xaml.cs reduced from 8,305 → 5,605 lines (−2,700 lines, −33%). Build: 0 errors throughout. Tests: 379/379 passing at every step.

**Files created:**
- `SquadDash/AgentStatusCard.cs` (322 lines) — `INotifyPropertyChanged` view-model for agent cards; accent colour palette; `SidebarEntry` types
- `SquadDash/ColorUtilities.cs` (54 lines) — Static HSL/RGB math helpers
- `SquadDash/SquadCliAdapter.cs` (124 lines) — OS/process interaction: CLI version resolution, PowerShell window launch, Explorer, external links
- `SquadDash/PushToTalkController.cs` (243 lines) — Double-Ctrl PTT state machine; Azure speech service lifecycle
- `SquadDash/MarkdownDocumentRenderer.cs` (772 lines) — Markdown → WPF `Block`/`Inline` conversion
- `SquadDash/AgentThreadRegistry.cs` (840 lines) — Agent thread lifecycle; aliasing; identity normalisation; 6–12 aliases per thread via `AliasThreadKeys`
- `SquadDash/TranscriptConversationManager.cs` (481 lines) — Conversation persistence: load/save/persist, turn records, history navigation, emergency save
- `SquadDash/BackgroundTaskPresenter.cs` (813 lines) — Background task tracking; completion detection; delayed-promotion pipeline; display label building
- `SquadDash/PromptExecutionController.cs` (923 lines) — Prompt execution: `ExecutePromptAsync`, all slash-command handlers, prompt health monitoring, universe selection, quick-reply disabling

---

### 2026-04-17 — PromptExecutionController partial-class phase skipped

**Context:** The decomposition plan recommended a Phase 1 partial-class split of MainWindow before the full PromptExecutionController extraction, as a de-risking step.

**Decision:** Skip the partial-class phase; implement both phases in a single pass.

**Rationale:** By the time PEC was reached, the delegation pattern was well-established from eight prior extractions. The partial-class step would have produced a PR consisting entirely of renames and file splits — zero behaviour change, but still requiring full review and test verification. The hardest parts (constructor wiring, `_isPromptRunning` ownership, `PromptHealthTimer` transfer, `ActiveToolName` relocation) were not made safer by the partial-class intermediate step.

**Outcome:** `PromptExecutionController.cs` extracted in one pass, 923 lines, 0 errors, 379/379 tests passing.

---

### 2026-04-17 — Workspace sidebar removed in favour of menu

**Context:** The `.squad Workspace` sidebar panel consumed a fixed 280px column and required a two-column grid layout in `MainWindow.xaml`. Its content (links to `.md` files in the `.squad` folder) duplicated navigation already available via the file system, and was always visible regardless of whether users needed it.

**Decision:** Remove the sidebar panel entirely. Move all workspace file links to a `Workspace` top-level menu item. Show individual `.md` file links only when those files exist on disk; always show "Squad Folder" (opens Explorer to `.squad`).

**Outcome:** `MainWindow.xaml` reverts to a single-column layout. `RefreshSidebar()` now populates `WorkspaceMenuItem.Items` dynamically. `SidebarEnabled` and `OpenSquadFolderEnabled` removed from `InteractiveControlState`.

---

### 2026-04-17 — Post-extraction architectural health check (Orion Vale, Audit #2)

**Context:** Following the 9-class MainWindow decomposition and completion of the full original backlog (layer fix, markdown dedup, `IWorkspacePaths`, `JsonFileStorage`, CI pipeline), a fresh architectural audit was conducted on the resulting codebase.

**Findings summary:**

| # | Severity | Concern |
|---|----------|---------|
| 1 | Critical | Zero test coverage for all 9 extracted classes (~4,000 lines of untested logic) |
| 2 | High | `AgentThreadRegistry` exposes backing `Dictionary`/`List` fields as mutable properties — callers bypass aliasing invariants |
| 3 | High | `PromptExecutionController` constructor has 40+ parameters — testing requires 40 mock lambdas; signals continued over-responsibility |
| 4 | High | `_isPromptRunning` ownership is ambiguous: field lives in MainWindow, written by PEC via delegate, read by BackgroundTaskPresenter via delegate |
| 5 | Medium | `TranscriptConversationManager` leaks all internal state as settable properties — acts as a data bag, not a service |
| 6 | Medium | `_toolEntries` dictionary owned by MainWindow, mutated at 8 callsites, with no encapsulating owner |
| 7 | Low | `QuickReplyInstruction` constant duplicated (MainWindow + PEC) — dead copy in MainWindow |
| 8 | Low | `QuickReplyAgentContinuationWindow` constant duplicated (MainWindow + MarkdownDocumentRenderer) |
| 9 | Low | `PromptNoActivityWarning/Stall` thresholds duplicated (MainWindow + PEC) — dead copies in MainWindow |

**Immediate fixes applied (this audit):**
- Removed dead `QuickReplyInstruction` constant from MainWindow (owned and used only by `PromptExecutionController`)
- Removed dead `PromptNoActivityWarningThreshold` and `PromptNoActivityStallThreshold` from MainWindow (owned and used only by `PromptExecutionController`)
- Removed duplicate `QuickReplyAgentContinuationWindow` from MainWindow; line 3043 now references `MarkdownDocumentRenderer.QuickReplyAgentContinuationWindow`
- All 388 tests pass; 0 build errors

**Delegated work items:**

**DEL-1 [Critical] — Test coverage for extracted classes** → Assign to Vesper Knox (testing & quality) — **COMPLETE**
~~Write unit tests for the extractable logic in: `AgentThreadRegistry` (thread key aliasing, `GetOrCreateAgentThread`, `FindAgentThread`), `TranscriptConversationManager` (history navigation, session ID management), `BackgroundTaskPresenter` (completion detection, label building), `ColorUtilities` (HSL/RGB math). Note: `MarkdownDocumentRenderer` and `PromptExecutionController` require WPF dispatcher — integration-test or use a thin seam/adapter pattern.~~
**Outcome (verified 2026-04-18):** `ColorUtilitiesTests.cs` (13 tests), `AgentThreadRegistryTests.cs` (17 tests), `BackgroundTaskPresenterTests.cs` (9 tests), `TranscriptConversationManagerTests.cs` (7 tests). Test project upgraded to `net10.0-windows` + `<UseWPF>true</UseWPF>`. `MainWindowStub.cs` created for static method surface. Total suite: 456 tests passing. Gaps deferred: `MarkdownDocumentRenderer` and `PromptExecutionController` (require live WPF dispatcher/STA environment).

**DEL-2 [High] — Seal `AgentThreadRegistry` collections** → ~~Assign to Arjun Sen~~ **COMPLETE**
~~Replace `internal Dictionary<string, TranscriptThreadState> ThreadsByKey` (and the other three exposed collections) with read-only facade accessors (`IReadOnlyDictionary`, `IReadOnlyList`). All mutation must go through `AgentThreadRegistry` methods. Add `ContainsThread`, `TryGetByToolCallId`, `AllThreads` accessors as needed. Callers are: MainWindow (6 sites), BackgroundTaskPresenter (3 sites), TranscriptConversationManager (4 sites).~~
**Outcome (verified 2026-04-18):** All four collections (`ThreadsByKey`, `ThreadsByToolCallId`, `LaunchesByToolCallId`, `ThreadOrder`) now typed as `IReadOnly*`. `ToolEntries` (formerly `_toolEntries` — see DEL-4) also exposed as `IReadOnlyDictionary`. All mutation internal to `AgentThreadRegistry`. AgentThreadRegistry.cs now 875 lines.

**DEL-3 [High] — Migrate `_isPromptRunning` ownership to `PromptExecutionController`** → Assign to Lyra Morn
Move the `_isPromptRunning` field from MainWindow into PEC as an `internal bool IsPromptRunning { get; private set; }`. Remove the `getIsPromptRunning`/`setIsPromptRunning` delegate pair from the PEC constructor. Update all MainWindow read-sites to use `_pec.IsPromptRunning`. This collapses ~5 constructor parameters into one reference.

**DEL-4 [Medium] — Encapsulate `_toolEntries` in `AgentThreadRegistry`** → ~~Assign to Arjun Sen (bundle with DEL-2)~~ **COMPLETE**
~~Move `_toolEntries: Dictionary<string, ToolTranscriptEntry>` from MainWindow into `AgentThreadRegistry` (it tracks tool calls per agent thread). Expose typed accessors: `GetOrAddToolEntry`, `TryGetToolEntry`, `AllIncompleteToolEntries`, `ClearAll`. Removes 8 raw-dict mutations from MainWindow.~~
**Outcome (verified 2026-04-18):** `ToolEntries` is `IReadOnlyDictionary<string, ToolTranscriptEntry>` on `AgentThreadRegistry`. Bundled with DEL-2 as planned.

**DEL-5 [Medium] — Reduce `TranscriptConversationManager` leaky setters** → Assign to Lyra Morn (bundle with DEL-3)
Replace the 6 raw settable properties (`ConversationState`, `CurrentSessionId`, `HistoryIndex`, etc.) with purpose-built methods (`BeginSession(sessionId)`, `ClearSession()`, `SetConversationState(state)`). Callers in MainWindow should use the method API.

**Deferred (observe-only):**
- `PromptExecutionController` 40-parameter constructor: structurally sound for now; will naturally improve as DEL-3 and DEL-2 reduce delegate count. Revisit after DEL-2/3/4.
- MainWindow still at 4,634 lines / 231 methods: below the alarm threshold post-extraction; monitor but no immediate action.

### 2026-04-17 — Persistence layer / display layer violation resolved; IWorkspacePaths contract defined

**By:** Orion Vale

**Layer violation (DONE):** `WorkspaceConversationStore` (persistence layer) was calling `ToolTranscriptFormatter.BuildDetailContent` (display layer). Fix: extracted `ToolTranscriptDescriptor`, `ToolTranscriptDetail`, `ToolEditDiffSummary`, and `ToolTranscriptDetailContent.Build()` into `ToolTranscriptData.cs`. `WorkspaceConversationStore` now calls `ToolTranscriptDetailContent.Build()` directly. No functional change — all 379 tests pass.

**IWorkspacePaths (contract defined, wiring pending):** `WorkspacePaths` was a mutable static service-locator. `IWorkspacePaths` interface and `WorkspacePathsProvider` (immutable, constructor-injected) have been created. Full call-site migration (20+ sites across UI, backend services, launcher) is delegated — see task below. Static `WorkspacePaths.cs` stays until migration is complete.

**Why:** Persistence layer must not depend on display layer — strict architectural rule. `IWorkspacePaths` enables constructor injection and eliminates the mutable-global initialization race. Both changes are zero functional-impact.

---

### 2026-04-17 — Task: Wire IWorkspacePaths across all call sites

**By:** Orion Vale (delegated)
**Owners:** Arjun Sen (backend: `SquadCliAdapter`, `SquadSdkProcess`, `SquadDashRuntimeStamp`, `PromptExecutionController`) + Lyra Morn (UI: `App.xaml.cs`, `MainWindow`, `AgentInfoWindow`, `WorkspaceIssuePresentation`) + Jae Min Kade (launcher: `SquadDashLauncher/Program.cs`) — **COMPLETE**

**What:** Replace all `WorkspacePaths.*` static calls with constructor-injected `IWorkspacePaths`. `App.xaml.cs` creates a `WorkspacePathsProvider` and passes it to `MainWindow`. Each service receives it as a constructor parameter. Delete `WorkspacePaths.cs` only after all call sites are migrated.

**Tests required:** `WorkspacePathsProviderTests.cs` — `Discover()`, constructor normalisation, all 4 properties non-empty, empty-string rejection.

**Outcome (verified 2026-04-18):** `IWorkspacePaths.cs` and `WorkspacePathsProvider.cs` present. `WorkspacePaths.cs` deleted (migration complete). `_workspacePaths` injected throughout `MainWindow.xaml.cs` and `App.xaml.cs`. `WorkspacePathsProviderTests.cs` present. ⚠️ README CI badge URL still has `{owner}/{repo}` placeholder — needs update when repo is pushed.

---

### 2026-04-17 — Task: Implement JsonFileStorage atomic-write helper

**By:** Orion Vale (delegated to Arjun Sen) — **COMPLETE**

**What:** Every store class (`ApplicationSettingsStore`, `PromptHistoryStore`, `RestartCoordinatorStateStore`, `RuntimeSlotStateStore`, `WorkspaceConversationStore`) duplicates a ~10-line atomic temp-file write pattern. Create `SquadDash\JsonFileStorage.cs` with `JsonFileStorage.AtomicWrite<T>(string path, T payload, JsonSerializerOptions? options = null)` and replace all 5 duplicates.

**Tests required:** `JsonFileStorageTests.cs` — new file (Move path), existing file (Copy/Delete path), partial-write safety, round-trip. Add `JsonFileStorage.cs` to test project compile items.

**Outcome (verified 2026-04-18):** `JsonFileStorage.cs` created (34 lines). All 5 stores confirmed delegating to `JsonFileStorage.AtomicWrite`. `JsonFileStorageTests.cs` present in test project.

### 2026-04-17 — Task: Remove markdown rendering duplication from MainWindow

**By:** Orion Vale (delegated to Lyra Morn) — **COMPLETE**

**What:** `MainWindow.xaml.cs` still contains duplicates of 11 markdown rendering methods that already live in `MarkdownDocumentRenderer.cs` (including `AppendInlineMarkdown`, `BuildMarkdownTable`, `TryReadMarkdownLink`, etc.). Replace all MainWindow call sites with calls through the renderer instance; promote methods from `private` to `internal` on the renderer as needed; delete the duplicates from MainWindow.

**Out of scope:** `SquadTeamRosterLoader.ParseMarkdownRow`, `MarkdownHtmlBuilder`, `MarkdownFlowDocumentBuilder`.

**Outcome (verified 2026-04-18):** No markdown method definitions remain in `MainWindow.xaml.cs`; all occurrences are call sites through `_markdownRenderer`. MarkdownDocumentRenderer.cs is 793 lines (canonical owner).

---

### 2026-04-17 — Task: CI pipeline (GitHub Actions)

**By:** Orion Vale (delegated to Jae Min Kade) — **COMPLETE**

**What:** Create `.github/workflows/ci.yml` — build and test on push to `main` and PRs to `main`. Use `windows-latest` (WPF requires Windows), .NET 10, Node 20 (for `Squad.SDK` esproj build). Steps: checkout → setup-dotnet → setup-node (with npm cache on `Squad.SDK/package-lock.json`) → `dotnet restore` → `dotnet build --no-incremental --no-restore` → `dotnet test SquadDash.Tests/SquadDash.Tests.csproj --no-build`.

**Outcome (verified 2026-04-18):** `.github/workflows/ci.yml` present and correctly structured. CI badge added to `README.md`. ⚠️ Badge URL uses `{owner}/{repo}` placeholder — Jae Min Kade to update with real GitHub repo coordinates when repo is pushed.

### 2026-04-22 — Policy: Agents must report bare commit hash in transcript after every commit

**Scope:** All agents · All commits · All sessions from 2026-04-22 onward

**What:** Every agent that makes a `git commit` must include the resulting **short commit hash (7 chars) as plain text** in their transcript response — placed immediately after describing the commit. Do **not** construct a markdown hyperlink or embed a GitHub URL.

**Format:**
```
Committed: `a1b2c3d`
```

**Example:**
> Committed all changes. `a1b2c3d`

**How to obtain the short hash after committing:**
```bash
git rev-parse --short HEAD   # → a1b2c3d
```

**Why:** SquadDash auto-detects bare commit hashes in transcript text and wraps them in the correct hyperlinks automatically — no manual URL construction needed. Constructing the URL manually caused agents to hallucinate the wrong repo owner/name (e.g. `bradygaster/SquadDash` instead of `MillerMark/SquadDash`), producing broken links. Plain hash = correct link every time.

**Anti-patterns:**
- ❌ Constructing a markdown link: `` [`a1b2c3d`](https://github.com/...) `` — causes hallucination, app auto-links anyway
- ❌ Mentioning a commit without including the hash at all
- ❌ Using the full 40-char hash (use short 7-char hash)
- ❌ Using a branch name or relative ref (`HEAD`) instead of the hash

### 2026-04-26 — Documentation Mode

**Date:** 2026-04-26  
**Author:** Lyra Morn  
**Status:** Implemented  

## Decision

Added in-app Documentation Mode to SquadDash. Toggled via View → View Documentation. When active, a resizable panel appears to the right of the transcript containing a topic tree and markdown viewer.

## Rationale

Provides discoverability for new users without leaving the app. Keeps workspace context visible while reading docs. Self-teaching UI reduces friction.

## Implementation

- **XAML layout:** `TranscriptPanelsGrid` now has 3 columns: transcript (auto-width), splitter (8px when visible), docs panel (600px when visible).
- **Docs panel:** Left side = TreeView with hierarchical topics. Right side = WebBrowser rendering markdown via `MarkdownHtmlBuilder.Build()`.
- **Theme-aware:** All surfaces use `DynamicResource` (PanelSurface, PanelBorder, LabelText) for light/dark theme compatibility.
- **Interaction with full-screen mode:** Docs panel hidden when full-screen transcript mode is active. Transcript takes priority.
- **Stub for future:** "Add Document" button present but not wired — placeholder for user-contributed docs.

## Welcome content

Default markdown welcome message introduces SquadDash features and instructs user to select topics from tree. Topics pre-populated with placeholder nodes (Getting Started, Agents, Workspace, Settings).

## Next steps

- Wire topic tree selection to load specific markdown content
- Implement "Add Document" workflow (file picker → copy to `.squad/docs/` → refresh tree)
- Persist docs mode state across sessions via `AppConfig.json`

### 2026-04-26 — Transcript UI fixes (3 of 4 complete)

**By:** Lyra Morn  
**Status:** 3 completed, 1 deferred

## Completed

**Fix 1: Title Format** ✅  
Changed secondary transcript title from "Agent — from 2 min ago" to "Agent - 2 min ago" in `BuildSecondaryTranscriptTitle`.

**Fix 3: Countdown Cancellation** ✅  
Transcript auto-close countdown now permanently cancels on user interaction (mouse move, clicks, wheel). Added `CountdownCancelled` flag to `SecondaryTranscriptEntry` and wired handlers on `PanelBorder`.

**Fix 4: Card Hover Glow** ✅  
Agent cards now animate a glow effect when hovering over open transcript panels. Added `MouseEnter`/`MouseLeave` handlers with `DropShadowEffect` and auto-reversing animation.

## Deferred

**Fix 2: "Transcript button must NOT close main transcript"** ⏳  
Requires clarification from user Mark003. Current behavior analysis shows `SelectTranscriptThread` changes the main view but does not hide the main panel. Possible interpretations:
1. Links should open as secondary panels rather than switching main view
2. Secondary panels should not auto-close when opening from within them
3. Existing behavior already implements requirement

**Recommendation:** Clarify actual unwanted behavior with user.

## Outcome

`eb3836b` — Fixes 1, 3, 4 committed. 724/726 tests passing (2 pre-existing unrelated failures).

### 2026-04-26 — Transcript link navigation pattern changed

**By:** Lyra Morn  
**Status:** Implemented

## Decision

Transcript hyperlinks inside the main transcript now open secondary panels instead of replacing the main transcript's content. The coordinator transcript still switches the main view when clicked.

## Context

When users clicked on transcript links (e.g., to view agent transcripts) from within the main transcript window, the `TranscriptHyperlink_Click` handler called `OpenTranscriptThread`, which invoked `SelectTranscriptThread`. This directly replaced the main transcript's document, hiding the current conversation and making it difficult to compare transcripts or return to the original context.

## Implementation

Modified `OpenTranscriptThread` method (MainWindow.xaml.cs, lines 4928-4943):

- For coordinator transcript links: Keep existing behavior (switch main view via `SelectTranscriptThread`)
- For agent transcript links: Use `OpenSecondaryPanel` instead (same code path as agent card clicks)
- Added `FindAgentCardForThread` lookup to map thread → card before opening panel
- Added null check for cases where no card exists for a thread

## Rationale

**Consistency:** Clicking an agent transcript link now behaves identically to clicking the agent's card — both open a secondary panel. Users get a predictable, unified navigation model.

**Non-destructive:** The main transcript remains visible and unchanged. Users can view multiple transcripts simultaneously and easily switch between contexts.

**Discoverability:** By reusing the existing secondary panel infrastructure, we leverage all the existing features (close buttons, title updates, auto-scrolling, accent colors, etc.) without code duplication.

## Impact

- Main transcript is never hidden/replaced when clicking agent transcript links
- Secondary panels can be opened from within transcripts (not just from agent cards)
- Coordinator transcript links still switch the main view (expected behavior for returning to main conversation)
- No breaking changes to existing panel management logic

## Testing

- Build: 0 errors, 0 warnings
- Tests: 724/726 passing (2 pre-existing failures in TranscriptSelectionTests unrelated to this change)
- Manual verification recommended: Click transcript links in main window and verify secondary panels open

## Commit

`6745aef` — "fix: transcript links open in new window instead of replacing main transcript"

### Decision: Update OnAgentLeftActivePanel Test Semantics

**Date:** 2024  
**Decided by:** Vesper Knox (Testing & Quality Specialist)  
**Status:** Implemented  
**Commit:** 47533dd

## Context

Two tests in `TranscriptSelectionTests.cs` were failing:
- `OnAgentLeftActivePanel_ClosesAllAgentPanels` — expected panels to close, but closedThreads was empty
- `OnAgentLeftActivePanel_LastPanel_FallsBackToMain` — expected ShowMainRequested to fire, but it didn't

Investigation revealed these were **stale tests** testing behavior that was intentionally removed in commit `0822ba2` ("shift-click empty transcript, voice PTT, docs panel preservation").

## The Design Change (0822ba2)

The production method `TranscriptSelectionController.OnAgentLeftActivePanel` was deliberately changed to a **no-op**:

```csharp
public void OnAgentLeftActivePanel(AgentStatusCard card)
{
    // Do not directly close panels here. MainWindow tracks whether a panel was
    // auto-opened versus user-pinned, and its auto-close countdown owns the
    // actual close timing.
}
```

**Rationale:** Panel auto-close timing is now owned by MainWindow's countdown mechanism, which knows whether a panel was auto-opened vs. user-pinned. `OnAgentLeftActivePanel` should not interfere with this logic.

## Decision

Update the two failing tests to **document the new no-op contract** rather than remove them:

### Test 1: `OnAgentLeftActivePanel_DoesNotClosePanels_MainWindowCountdownOwnsClose`
- **Previously expected:** Panels would close when an agent left the active panel
- **Now verifies:** Panels remain open; ClosePanelRequested does NOT fire
- **Why keep it:** Documents that panel closing is no longer this method's responsibility

### Test 2: `OnAgentLeftActivePanel_DoesNotFallBackToMain_MainWindowCountdownOwnsClose`
- **Previously expected:** ShowMainRequested would fire when the last panel is closed
- **Now verifies:** ShowMainRequested does NOT fire
- **Why keep it:** Documents that fallback-to-main logic is MainWindow's responsibility

Both tests now:
- Include comments explaining the intentional no-op design
- Assert the **absence** of old behaviors (empty closedThreads, showMainFired = false)
- Retain the same setup to serve as documentation of the contract

## Outcome

- All 726 tests pass ✓
- Tests now accurately reflect production behavior as of 0822ba2
- Future maintainers will understand that `OnAgentLeftActivePanel` is intentionally a no-op

## Related Files

- `SquadDash.Tests/TranscriptSelectionTests.cs` (lines 233–275)
- `SquadDash/TranscriptSelectionController.cs` (lines 92–97)

## Governance

- All meaningful changes require team consensus
- Document architectural decisions here
- Keep history focused on work, decisions focused on direction

# UI Fixes: Transcript Layout, Agent Name Abbreviation, Hyperlink Theming

**Status:** Implemented  
**Decided:** 2026-04-27  
**Decider:** Lyra Morn (WPF & UI Specialist)  
**Commit:** `8a0ae77`

## Context

Three focused UI improvements were needed:
1. Transcript panels not filling available space when documentation panel was open
2. "General Purpose Agent" name too verbose in transcript titles
3. Hyperlink hover color in dark theme made text hard to read

## Decisions

### 1. Transcript Panel Layout — Remove Obsolete Docs Column Management

**Decision:** `RebuildTranscriptPanelsGrid()` no longer manages `DocsSplitterColumn` and `DocsPanelColumn`.

**Rationale:**  
Previous fix (commit `0822ba2`) moved `DocsSplitter` and `DocsPanel` from `TranscriptPanelsGrid` (row 3 only) to root grid (rows 1-4, full height span). However, `RebuildTranscriptPanelsGrid()` still contained logic to save/restore docs column widths and re-add them to `TranscriptPanelsGrid`. This created phantom column definitions that prevented transcript panels from expanding to fill available width when docs panel was open with multiple transcripts visible.

**Implementation:**
- Removed `docsSplitterWidth` / `docsPanelWidth` save/restore logic
- Removed `childrenToRemove.Where(c => c != DocsSplitter && c != DocsPanel)` filtering (docs elements aren't in this grid anymore)
- Removed all logic that re-adds docs columns to `TranscriptPanelsGrid.ColumnDefinitions`
- Simplified to: `Children.Clear()`, `ColumnDefinitions.Clear()`, add only transcript panel columns (star-sized) + splitters (8px)

**Outcome:** Transcript panels now properly fill the available space with evenly-sized star columns, regardless of how many panels are open or whether the docs panel is visible.

### 2. Agent Name Abbreviation — "GPA" for "General Purpose Agent"

**Decision:** Display "GPA" instead of "General Purpose Agent" in all transcript UI.

**Rationale:**  
"General Purpose Agent" is verbose and creates visual clutter in transcript titles, especially when combined with relative timestamps ("General Purpose Agent - 2 minutes ago"). Abbreviating to "GPA" maintains clarity while reducing horizontal space consumption.

**Implementation:**
- Added `AbbreviateAgentName(string name)` helper (line 4870) that performs case-insensitive replacement
- Applied to `BuildSecondaryTranscriptTitle()` for secondary panel headers
- Applied to `UpdateTranscriptThreadBadge()` for main transcript title display

**Scope:** All locations where agent names appear in transcript titles. Does not affect agent card labels or other UI contexts.

### 3. Hyperlink Hover Theming — Use Standard `HoverSurface`

**Decision:** Apply implicit `Hyperlink` style with `IsMouseOver` trigger using `{DynamicResource HoverSurface}`.

**Rationale:**  
Transcript hyperlinks (using `thread:` protocol in markdown, rendered as WPF `Hyperlink` elements) had no custom styling and used WPF's default hover behavior. In dark theme, this created poor contrast and made link text hard to read on hover. Standard buttons use `HoverSurface` for mouse-over state (`#252220` in dark, `#E8E0D4` in light), which provides good readability in both themes.

**Implementation:**
- Added implicit `<Style TargetType="Hyperlink">` in `App.xaml` (after TreeViewItem style, line 387)
- Added `IsMouseOver` trigger setting `Background` to `{DynamicResource HoverSurface}`
- Uses `DynamicResource` to respond to theme switches

**Scope:** All `Hyperlink` elements app-wide, including transcript links created by `MarkdownDocumentRenderer.TryReadMarkdownLink()`.

## Alternatives Considered

### Fix 1 — Transcript Layout
- **Alternative:** Manually calculate and set column widths to fill space  
  **Rejected:** WPF's star-sizing already does this; the issue was extra column definitions interfering with layout. Removing the obsolete code is simpler and more correct.

### Fix 2 — Agent Name Abbreviation
- **Alternative:** Abbreviate all long agent names (e.g., "General..." → "G...")  
  **Rejected:** Only "General Purpose Agent" was identified as problematic. Over-abbreviating other names could reduce clarity. Targeted fix is safer.

### Fix 3 — Hyperlink Hover
- **Alternative:** Create a custom brush specifically for hyperlink hover  
  **Rejected:** Reusing `HoverSurface` ensures consistency with button hover behavior and reduces duplication of theme values.

## Impact

- **User Experience:** Transcript panels now use full available width; cleaner titles; consistent hover feedback across UI elements
- **Maintainability:** Removed 40+ lines of obsolete docs column management code; centralized hover theming
- **Performance:** Negligible (layout calculation simplified)
- **Compatibility:** No breaking changes; works with existing transcript data and theme switching

## Testing

- **Build:** 0 errors, 0 warnings
- **Manual verification needed:**
  - Open 2-4 transcript panels with docs panel visible → panels fill width evenly
  - Hover over transcript links in dark theme → background uses `HoverSurface`, text remains readable
  - Open "General Purpose Agent" transcript → title shows "GPA - X ago" in secondary panel header and "GPA's transcript" in main view

## Related Decisions

- Commit `0822ba2`: Moved docs panel to root grid (full height span)
- Commit `eb3836b`: Secondary transcript title format ("Agent - X ago")
- Commit `da3bc95`: Implicit TreeViewItem style pattern (same approach for Hyperlink)

## Notes

The transcript layout fix is a cleanup of technical debt from the docs panel full-height fix. The other two fixes are polish improvements that enhance readability and reduce visual clutter in the transcript UI.

### 2026-04-26T12:00:51: docs/ scaffold created

**By:** Mira Quill  
**What:** Created initial `docs/` folder structure with 13 markdown files + `.gitkeep` placeholder  
**Why:** Serves as both real SquadDash documentation and living template for repo authors using the docs panel feature

---

## Files Created

- `docs/README.md` — Home/index with compelling overview
- `docs/SUMMARY.md` — GitBook-style TOC for tree navigation
- `getting-started/` — Installation, first run, images placeholder
- `concepts/` — Agents, squad-team, transcripts, documentation-panel
- `reference/` — Configuration, routing, keyboard-shortcuts
- `contributing/` — Adding-an-agent, writing-docs

Total: 18 files (13 .md, 4 README.md, 1 .gitkeep)

---

## Content Quality

All content is **real and useful** — no lorem ipsum or placeholders. Based on actual codebase exploration:
- README.md (project structure, SquadDash architecture, tool icons)
- .squad/team.md (agent roster, members table format)
- .squad/routing.md (routing table format, issue routing)
- SquadDash/ file structure (helper classes, services)
- decisions.md (MainWindow decomposition, architectural decisions)

Documented key features:
- Agent cards with hover-glow effect
- Shift-click to open transcripts
- Multi-agent transcript panels
- Voice PTT (double-Ctrl)
- Tool call icons (🔎 grep, ✏️ edit, 👀 view, 🤖 task, etc.)
- Routing table format
- team.md members table format
- docs panel tree view + markdown rendering

---

## Dual Purpose

1. **Real documentation** — SquadDash users and contributors can browse these docs inside the app's documentation panel
2. **Living template** — Repos using SquadDash can see a working example of the `docs/` structure and markdown rendering

---

## Next Steps

- Future: Add screenshots to `getting-started/images/`
- Future: Expand keyboard-shortcuts.md as features evolve
- Future: Add architecture diagrams to concepts/




# ADR-001: Phone Push Notifications for SquadDash

## Status
Proposed

## Context

SquadDash is a desktop WPF application that orchestrates long-running AI agent workflows. Users frequently need to step away from their desk while agents work, requiring awareness of completion states without constant desktop monitoring. The existing WPF UI provides rich visual feedback but requires the user to remain at the machine.

**User requirement:** Receive phone notifications for key workflow milestones (agent turn complete, loop complete, git commits) without requiring the SquadDash window to be in focus.

**Technical environment:**
- WPF desktop application running on Windows
- Event-driven architecture via `SquadSdkEvent` delivered from SDK bridge to `MainWindow.HandleEvent`
- Settings persisted via `ApplicationSettingsStore` (JSON-based atomic writes to `%LocalAppData%\SquadDash\settings.json`)
- Existing service decomposition: `PromptExecutionController`, `BackgroundTaskPresenter`, `TranscriptConversationManager`, `AgentThreadRegistry`

## Decision

**Implement pluggable push notification architecture with ntfy.sh as the primary delivery mechanism, designed to support Pushover, Telegram, and SMS as future additions.**

### Delivery Mechanism

**Phase 1 (Immediate Implementation):** ntfy.sh only  
**Phase 2 (Future):** Add Pushover, Telegram Bot, Twilio SMS as selectable providers

**Rationale for ntfy.sh first:**
1. **Zero friction onboarding:** No API keys, no account creation, no per-message cost
2. **HTTP-trivial integration:** Single `POST https://ntfy.sh/{topic}` with message body
3. **Self-service subscription:** User scans QR code on their phone → auto-subscribes to the topic
4. **Adequate for MVP:** Handles notification delivery reliably; advanced features (priority, sounds, custom icons) deferred to Pushover phase

**Why not Pushover first?**
- $5 purchase barrier before testing
- Requires API key management (user + app keys)
- Better suited as an upgrade path for power users after ntfy.sh proves the pattern

**Why not Telegram/SMS first?**
- Telegram: Higher friction for non-Telegram users (requires Telegram app + bot interaction)
- Twilio SMS: Ongoing per-message cost model; overkill for this use case

**Pluggable design justification:** The HTTP POST pattern is identical across all candidates (URL + headers + JSON body). Abstracting early costs nothing and prevents ntfy.sh lock-in.

---

## Event Taxonomy

Only events representing **workflow completion milestones** should trigger notifications. Streaming progress (thinking_delta, response_delta, tool_progress) is too noisy for phone interrupts.

| Event Name | Default Enabled | Rationale | Owner |
|------------|-----------------|-----------|-------|
| `assistant_turn_complete` | ✅ Yes | Core use case: AI finished answering your prompt. Primary notification trigger. | Talia (SDK event surfacing) |
| `git_commit_pushed` | ❌ No | Optional for users with git-heavy workflows. Can be spammy in rapid-commit scenarios. | Arjun (C# git event detection) |
| `loop_iteration_complete` | ❌ No | Mid-loop checkpoints — useful for very long loops. Default off to avoid notification storms. | Talia (loop events already surfaced) |
| `loop_stopped` | ✅ Yes | Loop workflow finished or manually stopped — clear endpoint signal. | Talia |
| `rc_connection_established` | ❌ No | Nice-to-know status update, not workflow-critical. Default off. | Talia (RC events already surfaced) |
| `rc_connection_dropped` | ✅ Yes | Failure signal — user needs to know remote access broke. | Talia |
| `long_running_task_complete` | 🟡 Deferred | Future: task agents taking >5 minutes. Requires new event type. | Talia (new event) + Arjun (detection) |

**Implementation note:** `assistant_turn_complete` does **not** exist as a discrete `SquadSdkEvent.Type` today. The `"done"` event at line 1403 of `MainWindow.xaml.cs` is the semantic equivalent. **Owner: Talia** to either (a) emit `assistant_turn_complete` from SDK or (b) confirm `"done"` is the canonical signal for notification purposes.

**Per-event toggles:** Settings UI will expose checkboxes for each event type. Stored in `ApplicationSettingsSnapshot.NotificationEventToggles: IReadOnlyDictionary<string, bool>`.

---

## Configuration Architecture

### Storage Location
**Global (machine-wide) settings, not per-workspace.**

**Rationale:**
- Notification endpoints (ntfy topic, Pushover keys, phone number) are user identity, not project-specific
- User wants the same phone to receive notifications regardless of which SquadDash workspace is open
- Consistent with existing global settings: `UserName`, `SpeechRegion`, `LastUsedModel`, `Theme`

### Schema (ApplicationSettingsSnapshot additions)

```csharp
// Added to ApplicationSettingsSnapshot record (ApplicationSettingsStore.cs ~line 515)
public sealed record ApplicationSettingsSnapshot(
    // ... existing parameters ...
    IReadOnlyDictionary<string, string> IgnoredRoutingIssueFingerprintsByWorkspace)
{
    // ... existing properties ...

    /// <summary>
    /// Push notification delivery provider. "ntfy", "pushover", "telegram", "twilio", or null (disabled).
    /// </summary>
    public string? NotificationProvider { get; init; }

    /// <summary>
    /// Endpoint configuration for the selected provider.
    /// ntfy: { "topic": "my-squad-dash-abc123" }
    /// pushover: { "user_key": "...", "api_token": "..." }
    /// telegram: { "bot_token": "...", "chat_id": "..." }
    /// twilio: { "account_sid": "...", "auth_token": "...", "from": "+1...", "to": "+1..." }
    /// </summary>
    public IReadOnlyDictionary<string, string>? NotificationEndpoint { get; init; }

    /// <summary>
    /// Per-event enable/disable toggles.
    /// Key = event name (e.g., "assistant_turn_complete"), Value = enabled (true) or disabled (false).
    /// Missing keys inherit default from Event Taxonomy table above.
    /// </summary>
    public IReadOnlyDictionary<string, bool>? NotificationEventToggles { get; init; }
}
```

### ApplicationSettingsStore Methods (Arjun)

```csharp
// Add to ApplicationSettingsStore class
public ApplicationSettingsSnapshot SaveNotificationProvider(
    string? provider,
    IReadOnlyDictionary<string, string>? endpoint);

public ApplicationSettingsSnapshot SaveNotificationEventToggles(
    IReadOnlyDictionary<string, bool> toggles);
```

---

## Settings UI

### Placement
**Dedicated "Notifications" section in the existing `PreferencesWindow`.**

**Rationale:**
- PreferencesWindow already exists (`PreferencesWindow.cs`) and handles global settings (UserName, SpeechRegion, API Key)
- Avoids adding another top-level window to the application
- Groups related configuration in one location
- Consistent with existing settings UX patterns

### Layout (Wireframe-Level Description)

### Component Ownership: Lyra Morn (WPF/XAML specialist)

**Implementation notes:**
1. **QR Code rendering:** Use `QRCoder` NuGet package (already approved for RC mobile). Generate QR image from `https://ntfy.sh/{topic}`.
2. **"Generate Random Topic":** Button generates a secure topic name like `squad-dash-{username}-{guid-suffix}` to prevent topic collisions.
3. **"Test Notification":** Sends a test message via the configured endpoint to validate setup.
4. **Provider dropdown:** Initially shows only "ntfy.sh". Phase 2 adds "Pushover", "Telegram Bot", "Twilio SMS".
5. **Dynamic config panel:** Config UI (Topic / API Keys / etc.) swaps based on selected provider.

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: ntfy.sh Foundation (1 week)

#### Arjun Sen: C# Notification Service (2–3 days)
**File:** `SquadDash/PushNotificationService.cs`

```csharp
internal interface IPushNotificationProvider
{
    Task<bool> SendAsync(string title, string message, string? tags = null);
}

internal sealed class NtfyNotificationProvider : IPushNotificationProvider
{
    private readonly string _topic;
    private readonly HttpClient _httpClient;

    public NtfyNotificationProvider(string topic, HttpClient? httpClient = null)
    {
        if (string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(topic))
            throw new ArgumentException("ntfy topic cannot be empty", nameof(topic));
        _topic = topic;
        _httpClient = httpClient ?? new HttpClient { Timeout = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(5) };
    }

    public async Task<bool> SendAsync(string title, string message, string? tags = null)

        var settings = _getCurrentSettings();
        _currentProvider = settings.NotificationProvider switch
        {
            "ntfy" when settings.NotificationEndpoint?.TryGetValue("topic", out var topic) == true
                => new NtfyNotificationProvider(topic),
            // Phase 2: "pushover" => new PushoverNotificationProvider(...),
            _ => null
        };
    }

    public async Task NotifyEventAsync(string eventName, string title, string message)
    {
        var settings = _getCurrentSettings();
        var enabled = settings.NotificationEventToggles?.TryGetValue(eventName, out var toggle) == true
            ? toggle
            : GetDefaultEnabledState(eventName);

        if (!enabled || _currentProvider is null)
            return;

        SquadDashTrace.Write("Notifications", $"Sending: event={eventName} title={title}");
        await _currentProvider.SendAsync(title, message, tags: "computer,completed");
    }

    private static bool GetDefaultEnabledState(string eventName)
    {
        return eventName switch
        {
            "assistant_turn_complete" => true,
            "loop_stopped" => true,
            "rc_connection_dropped" => true,
            _ => false
        };
    }
}
```

**Integration point:** MainWindow constructor creates `_pushNotificationService` and wires `ReloadProvider()` after settings changes.

**Event hooks (3–5 call sites in MainWindow.HandleEvent):**

```csharp
// Line ~1403 in HandleEvent switch ("done" case)
case "done":
    _pec.ActiveToolName = null;
    FinalizeCurrentTurnResponse();
    CollapseCurrentTurnThinking();
    _conversationManager.SaveCurrentTurnToConversation(DateTimeOffset.Now);
    _backgroundTaskPresenter.RefreshLeadAgentBackgroundStatus();
    FlushDeferredSystemLines();
    // NEW:
    _ = _pushNotificationService.NotifyEventAsync(
        "assistant_turn_complete",
        "SquadDash",
        "AI response complete");
    break;

// Line ~1360 (loop_stopped case)
case "loop_stopped":
    HandleLoopStopped(evt);
    // NEW:
    _ = _pushNotificationService.NotifyEventAsync(
        "loop_stopped",
        "SquadDash",
        $"Loop stopped after {evt.LoopIteration ?? 0} iterations");
    break;

// Line ~1396 (rc_stopped case) — if user-initiated, skip notification
case "rc_stopped":
    HandleRcStopped(evt);
    // NEW (only if not graceful shutdown):
    if (!_remoteAccessGracefulShutdown) // need to track this flag
    {
        _ = _pushNotificationService.NotifyEventAsync(
            "rc_connection_dropped",
            "SquadDash",
            "Remote connection dropped");
    }
    break;
```

**Test:** `PushNotificationServiceTests.cs` — mock HttpClient, verify POST URL/headers/body.

#### Talia Rune: SDK Event Surfacing (1 day)

**Task:** Confirm whether `"done"` event is the canonical signal for `assistant_turn_complete` or if a new event type should be emitted.

**If new event needed:** Modify SDK bridge to emit `{ "Type": "assistant_turn_complete", ... }` after the final `"done"` event in a turn.

**Deliverable:** Document in `.squad/decisions.md` which event type C# should hook for notifications.

#### Lyra Morn: Settings UI (2–3 days)

**File:** `SquadDash/PreferencesWindow.cs` (extend existing)

### 2026-04-30 — `squad aspire` integration architecture

**Owner:** Orion Vale  
**Status:** Phase 1 implemented; Phase 2 deferred

**Context:** `squad aspire` is a CLI command in 0.9.5-insider that launches a .NET Aspire/OpenTelemetry dashboard. The task asked how SquadDash should integrate.

**What `squad aspire` does (investigation findings):**

- Launches `mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspire-dashboard:latest` via Docker (preferred) or `dotnet workload aspire`
- Dashboard UI: `http://localhost:18888`; OTLP gRPC endpoint: `localhost:4317`
- Sets `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:4317` in the calling process before spawning the dashboard
- The Squad SDK (`@bradygaster/squad-sdk`) has full OTel instrumentation — `initSquadTelemetry()` / `initAgentModeTelemetry()` are no-ops unless `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` is set

**Integration phases:**

#### Phase 1 — OTel auto-activation in the bridge process (✅ implemented 2026-04-30)

**Decision:** Call `initAgentModeTelemetry()` at the start of `runPrompt.ts main()`. This auto-activates tracing and metrics export when `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` is present in the environment (set by `squad aspire` or any external OTel collector). When the env var is absent, the call is a proven no-op — zero runtime cost.

**User workflow enabled by Phase 1:**
1. In a terminal: `npx squad aspire` (starts Dashboard + sets env var)
2. In the terminal where SquadDash is launched: set `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:4317`
3. SquadDash bridge auto-exports spans and metrics to the Aspire dashboard

**Files changed:**
- `Squad.SDK/runPrompt.ts` — added `import { initAgentModeTelemetry }` + call at `main()` start

#### Phase 2 — In-app Aspire dashboard launch (deferred)

**Decision:** Deferred to a separate milestone. Requires Docker or `dotnet workload aspire` to be installed on the user's machine — a significant external dependency. Blocked by:
1. No Docker/Aspire workload in the CI environment
2. UX questions: should SquadDash show a status indicator while Aspire runs? How does it detect when Docker is available?

**Planned implementation (for Phase 2 when ready):**
- NDJSON request type `aspire_start` — spawns Docker container, sets `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT`, emits `aspire_started`/`aspire_error`
- NDJSON request type `aspire_stop` — kills container, emits `aspire_stopped`
- C# `SquadSdkProcess`: `StartAspireAsync()` / `StopAspireAsync()` methods
- `MainWindow.xaml.cs`: Workspace → "🔭 Aspire Dashboard" toggle menu item
- Prerequisite check: emit `aspire_error` with install instructions if Docker is absent

**Risk note for Phase 2:** Spawning Docker from the bridge process is similar to the tunnel auto-start pattern (which uses ngrok/cloudflared), but Docker pull could be slow on first run and the container name collision case needs handling.

**Tasks:**
1. Add "Notifications" section to PreferencesWindow form stack
2. Add provider dropdown (initially single option: "ntfy.sh")
3. Add ntfy topic TextBox + "Generate Random Topic" button
4. Add QRCoder-based QR image display (refresh on topic change)
5. Add per-event checkboxes (load from settings, bind to UI)
6. Wire "Test Notification" button → calls `PushNotificationService.NotifyEventAsync("test", "Test", "SquadDash notifications are working!")`
7. Save button → `_settingsStore.SaveNotificationProvider(...)` + `_settingsStore.SaveNotificationEventToggles(...)`

**Dependencies:**
- QRCoder NuGet package (MIT license) — **already approved** per `.squad/tasks.md`
- `ApplicationSettingsStore.SaveNotificationProvider` + `SaveNotificationEventToggles` methods (Arjun)

**Test:** Manual verification — open Preferences, configure ntfy topic, scan QR code on phone, toggle event checkboxes, save, trigger notification event in app.

#### Integration (1 day)

**File:** `SquadDash/MainWindow.xaml.cs`

1. Add `_pushNotificationService` field
2. Wire in constructor after `_settingsStore` is created
3. Call `_pushNotificationService.ReloadProvider()` in `ApplySettings` after settings changes
4. Add notification hooks in `HandleEvent` switch statement (see Arjun section above)

### Phase 2: Multi-Provider Support (Future)

**Scope:** Add Pushover, Telegram Bot, Twilio SMS providers.

**Changes required:**
1. Arjun: Implement `PushoverNotificationProvider`, `TelegramNotificationProvider`, `TwilioNotificationProvider` classes implementing `IPushNotificationProvider`
2. Lyra: Extend Settings UI provider dropdown + add provider-specific config panels
3. Talia: No changes (events already surfaced)

**Timeline:** Post-MVP, user-requested feature based on feedback.

---

## Interface Contracts

### C# Interfaces

```csharp
// SquadDash/PushNotificationService.cs
internal interface IPushNotificationProvider
{
    /// <summary>
    /// Sends a push notification.
    /// </summary>
    /// <param name="title">Notification title (short, 1 line)</param>
    /// <param name="message">Notification body (1–3 lines)</param>
    /// <param name="tags">Optional comma-separated tags (e.g., "computer,completed")</param>
    /// <returns>True if sent successfully, false if failed (logs error to trace)</returns>
    Task<bool> SendAsync(string title, string message, string? tags = null);
}
```

### ApplicationSettingsStore Methods

```csharp
// SquadDash/ApplicationSettingsStore.cs (add to class)

/// <summary>
/// Saves notification provider and endpoint configuration.
/// </summary>
/// <param name="provider">"ntfy", "pushover", "telegram", "twilio", or null to disable</param>
/// <param name="endpoint">Provider-specific config keys (topic, API keys, phone numbers)</param>
public ApplicationSettingsSnapshot SaveNotificationProvider(
    string? provider,
    IReadOnlyDictionary<string, string>? endpoint)
{
    using var mutex = AcquireMutex();
    var current = LoadCore();
    var updated = current with
    {
        NotificationProvider = string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(provider) ? null : provider.Trim(),
        NotificationEndpoint = endpoint
    };
    SaveCore(updated);
    return updated;
}

/// <summary>
/// Saves per-event notification toggles.
/// </summary>
/// <param name="toggles">Event name → enabled (true/false)</param>
public ApplicationSettingsSnapshot SaveNotificationEventToggles(
    IReadOnlyDictionary<string, bool> toggles)
{
    using var mutex = AcquireMutex();
    var current = LoadCore();
    var updated = current with { NotificationEventToggles = toggles };
    SaveCore(updated);
    return updated;
}
```

### SDK Event (Talia to confirm)

**Option A:** Reuse `"done"` event  
**Option B:** Emit new event type `"assistant_turn_complete"` after `"done"`

**Deliverable:** Decision documented in `.squad/decisions.md` by end of Day 1.

---

## Risks & Mitigations

### Risk 1: ntfy.sh Topic Collisions
**Impact:** Two users pick the same topic name → receive each other's notifications.

**Mitigation:**
- Default topic generation includes username + GUID suffix: `squad-dash-{username}-{guid:N:8}`
- Example: `squad-dash-mark003-a7f3c2e1`
- Extremely low collision probability (8-char hex = 4 billion possibilities)

### Risk 2: Notification Spam
**Impact:** Loop with 100 iterations → 100 phone pings if `loop_iteration_complete` is enabled.

**Mitigation:**
- `loop_iteration_complete` defaults to **disabled**
- Documentation warns users this event is high-frequency
- Future enhancement: rate-limiting (max 1 notification per event type per 10 seconds)

### Risk 3: HTTP POST Failures
**Impact:** Notification silently fails to send; user never knows.

**Mitigation:**
- All HTTP failures logged to SquadDashTrace → visible in Trace window
- "Test Notification" button in Settings UI validates config before user relies on it
- Phase 2: Add in-app notification delivery status indicator (toast on failure)

### Risk 4: QRCoder NuGet Package Dependency
**Impact:** New external dependency increases attack surface, binary size.

**Mitigation:**
- QRCoder already approved for RC mobile (`.squad/tasks.md`)
- MIT license, no native dependencies, ~150 KB
- Well-maintained OSS library (1.4M+ downloads/month on NuGet)
- Acceptable tradeoff for UX benefit (QR scan vastly easier than manual URL entry)

### Risk 5: Sensitive Data in Settings
**Impact:** API keys (Pushover, Twilio) stored in plaintext JSON.

**Mitigation:**
- Phase 1 (ntfy): No API keys, only public topic name (low-sensitivity)
- Phase 2 (Pushover/Twilio): Use Windows DPAPI to encrypt sensitive fields before writing to JSON
- Existing pattern: Azure Speech API Key already uses environment variable (`SQUAD_SPEECH_KEY`) → extend to Notification API Keys
- **Recommendation:** Store Pushover/Twilio secrets in environment variables, not JSON

---

## Consequences

### What Changes
1. **New NuGet dependency:** QRCoder (~150 KB, MIT)
2. **ApplicationSettingsSnapshot schema expansion:** +3 properties (`NotificationProvider`, `NotificationEndpoint`, `NotificationEventToggles`)
3. **PreferencesWindow UI expansion:** +1 section (Notifications)
4. **MainWindow event handling:** +3–5 notification hooks in `HandleEvent` switch
5. **New service class:** `PushNotificationService.cs` (~200 lines)

### What Gets Easier
1. **User awareness:** No need to keep SquadDash window visible to track long-running workflows
2. **Mobile workflows:** Trigger a multi-hour loop, walk away, get notified on phone when complete
3. **Debugging async failures:** RC connection drops → instant phone notification rather than discovering it hours later

### What Gets Harder
1. **Settings complexity:** PreferencesWindow UI now has 6 sections (was 5)
2. **Event taxonomy maintenance:** Every new event type requires a decision: "notify-worthy or not?"
3. **Multi-provider testing:** Phase 2 requires manual testing across 4 providers (ntfy, Pushover, Telegram, Twilio)

### Non-Breaking Guarantees
1. **Notifications are opt-in:** Default state is disabled; user must explicitly configure topic/provider
2. **Zero impact if unconfigured:** No HTTP calls, no QR rendering, no perf cost
3. **Backward-compatible settings:** Existing `settings.json` files load normally; new fields are optional

---

## Open Questions for Mark003

1. **Git commit events:** Should we detect commits made **by SquadDash agents** only, or all commits in the workspace (including user manual commits)? Recommend agent-only to reduce noise.

2. **Rate limiting:** Should we implement "max 1 notification per event type per 10 seconds" in Phase 1, or defer to Phase 2 based on user feedback?

3. **Notification message detail:** For `assistant_turn_complete`, should the notification body include:
   - (a) "AI response complete" (generic)
   - (b) First 50 chars of response text (preview)
   - (c) Lead agent name + "turn complete"

   **Recommendation:** Option (c) — agent name provides context without leaking potentially sensitive response text.

4. **Environment variable precedence:** Should notification endpoints (topic, API keys) be overridable via environment variables for CI/test scenarios, or settings-file-only?

## Notification Event Hooks (2026-04-28)

**By:** Talia Rune (TypeScript & SDK Bridge Specialist)

Event hooks for `PushNotificationService` — confirmed by reading `Squad.SDK/runPrompt.ts`, `SquadDash/MainWindow.xaml.cs` (HandleEvent switch at line 1229), and `SquadDash/SquadSdkEvent.cs`.

- **assistant_turn_complete:** uses `"done"` event **[confirmed]**  
  Emitted in `runPrompt.ts` line 582 via `onDone()` callback — fires when the AI agent finishes its full response turn. Semantic match correct.

- **loop_stopped:** uses `"loop_stopped"` event **[confirmed]**  
  Emitted in `runPrompt.ts` lines 686 and 711 — fires when a loop subprocess exits cleanly (code 0 or killed) or when no loop is active and stop is requested. Semantic match correct.

- **rc_connection_dropped:** uses `"rc_stopped"` event **[confirmed]**  
  Emitted in `runPrompt.ts` lines 809 and 823 — fires when remote bridge is stopped (either no active bridge or after successful shutdown). Semantic match correct.

All three events exist in the TypeScript SDK, are emitted at the correct lifecycle moments, and are already handled in the C# `MainWindow.HandleEvent` switch statement. **No code changes needed.**

**Files verified:**
- `Squad.SDK/runPrompt.ts` — lines 582 (`done`), 686/711 (`loop_stopped`), 809/823 (`rc_stopped`)
- `SquadDash/MainWindow.xaml.cs` — lines 1403 (`done`), 1359 (`loop_stopped`), 1395 (`rc_stopped`)
- `SquadDash/SquadSdkEvent.cs` — event model definitions (LoopStatus, LoopMdPath, etc.)

## RC Mobile — SDK PR Ownership for Binary Audio Frames (2026-04-30)

**By:** Orion Vale (Lead Architect)
**Status:** Decided

### Decision

**Talia Rune** will author and submit the PR to @bradygaster/squad-sdk adding onAudioChunk, onAudioStart, and onAudioEnd to RemoteBridgeConfig.

**Rationale:** Talia owns the TypeScript/SDK bridge and event protocol layer (routing.md). The audio frame additions are SDK bridge protocol changes — new callback hooks on RemoteBridgeConfig that flow through the NDJSON event stream. This squarely falls within her domain, and she already has the deepest context on how RemoteBridgeConfig is shaped and consumed.

### Timeline constraint

The PR should **not be submitted until the audio format spike (Option C vs B) is resolved.** The callback interface may differ slightly depending on format:
- Option C (WEBM_OPUS): onAudioChunk carries raw WebM container frames — no chunking metadata needed beyond onAudioStart / onAudioEnd bookends.
- Option B (PCM/AudioWorklet): onAudioChunk must also carry sample-rate and channel metadata to support the NAudio resampling step on the C# side.

Submitting before that's known risks a follow-up breaking change to the PR.

### Expected merge timeline

Merge is contingent on Brady Gaster (upstream maintainer). Talia should:
1. Open the spike on Option C first (see RC mobile — spike Option C task).
2. Submit the PR within one session after the format is confirmed.
3. Treat the merge date as an external dependency — unblock local development by running a patched local copy of the SDK in the meantime (consistent with the existing patches/ pattern in this repo).

### Risk

This is the **critical-path scheduling risk** for RC phone voice input. If the upstream PR stalls, the patched-SDK approach is the mitigation — Talia maintains the local patch until merge lands.

## RC Mobile — Audio Format Spike: Option C (WEBM_OPUS) vs Option B (PCM) (2026-04-30)

**By:** Talia Rune (TypeScript & SDK Bridge Specialist)
**Status:** Decided — spike complete

### Spike Result

**Option C (WEBM_OPUS) is NOT available in Microsoft.CognitiveServices.Speech 1.49.0.**

Verified by reflecting on the installed NuGet DLL (
etstandard2.0 target):

`
AudioStreamContainerFormat enum values in SDK 1.49.0:
  OGG_OPUS  = 257
  MP3       = 258
  FLAC      = 259
  ALAW      = 260
  MULAW     = 261
  AMRNB     = 262
  AMRWB     = 263
  ANY       = 264
`

WEBM_OPUS is absent. No CreatePushStream overload accepting a compressed container format for WebM exists.

### Why OGG_OPUS is also ruled out

OGG_OPUS (257) is present in the SDK. However, browser MediaRecorder support for OGG container is unreliable:
- Firefox supports OGG_OPUS recording natively.
- Chrome and Safari do **not** — MediaRecorder in those browsers only outputs udio/webm;codecs=opus.

Using OGG_OPUS would produce a Chrome/Safari failure, which is unacceptable for a mobile feature targeting phone browsers.

### Decision: Proceed with Option B (PCM via AudioWorklet + NAudio transcoding)

The WebAudio AudioWorklet pipeline (Option B) is confirmed as the required path:

1. **Phone side:** AudioWorklet extracts raw PCM frames (16-bit, 16 kHz, mono) from the browser microphone and sends them over the WebSocket as binary frames.
2. **C# side:** SquadDash receives binary frames and writes them directly into the existing PushAudioInputStream (configured with AudioStreamFormat.GetWaveFormatPCM(16000, 16, 1)), which is already the format used by desktop PTT.
3. **No NAudio transcoding required** — if the AudioWorklet resamples to 16 kHz/16-bit/mono natively, the PCM frames can be written directly. NAudio is only needed if the phone sends a different sample rate.

### Implementation notes for Talia / Arjun

- The onAudioChunk callback in RemoteBridgeConfig must carry ArrayBuffer (binary PCM frames).
- The SDK PR (see SDK PR Ownership decision, 2026-04-30) should define onAudioChunk(data: ArrayBuffer): void.
- AudioWorklet processor target format: 16 kHz, 16-bit signed little-endian, mono.
- C# side: no new Azure SDK dependency needed — existing PushAudioInputStream + SpeechRecognitionService pattern works unchanged.

## RC Mobile — PTT-During-LLM-Run Policy (2026-04-30)

**By:** Orion Vale (Lead Architect)
**Status:** Decided

### Context

When a user initiates PTT (push-to-talk) on the phone while an LLM response is already streaming, the three options were:

- **(a) Queue the voice prompt** — record and hold; submit when the current run completes.
- **(b) Abort the current run** — interrupt the in-flight LLM response and start the new voice prompt.
- **(c) Reject with feedback** — block PTT initiation and show the user a status message; auto-unblock when the run ends.

### Decision: Option (c) — Reject with graceful feedback, auto-unblock

**Policy:** When PTT is initiated on the phone while _isPromptRunning is true, the phone UI:

1. Shows **"⏳ AI is responding — wait before speaking"** (or equivalent localized copy).
2. **Disables the PTT button** (visual feedback: greyed out or pulsing).
3. **Auto-unblocks** when the "done" event fires from unPrompt.ts — the same event used for push notification turn-complete hooks.
4. Clears the status message and re-enables the PTT button once unblocked.

**Audio is never captured during the blocked window** — the AudioWorklet is not started until PTT is unblocked. This avoids wasted bandwidth and confusing UX where audio is captured but the prompt is silently dropped.

### Why not the other options

- **Option (a) — Queue:** Queuing voice audio on the phone adds significant complexity (buffer management, timeout handling if recording is long, stale audio problem if the LLM run takes >30s). The desktop does not queue PTT either; the _isPromptRunning guard simply prevents PTT from starting. Consistency with desktop behavior argues against queuing on mobile.
- **Option (b) — Abort:** Aborting an in-flight LLM run is destructive — partial tool calls may be abandoned, the AI may be mid-sentence. This option is reserved for explicit user action (the Abort button), not for accidental PTT on a phone.

### Implementation notes

**TypeScript/RC bridge side (Talia):**
- When handleRcStart wires the RemoteBridgeConfig, it should expose a "busy" status push mechanism to each connected phone.
- When _isPromptRunning transitions true → false (i.e., "done" event received in C#), C# pushes an "rc_status" message over the WebSocket with { status: "idle" }.
- Complementary: when _isPromptRunning transitions false → true, push { status: "busy" }.

**Phone browser side (Talia):**
- PTT button listens for c_status messages.
- On { status: "busy" }: disable button, show "⏳ AI is responding…" overlay.
- On { status: "idle" }: re-enable button, clear overlay.
- On PTT hold-start while already usy: show message and swallow the event (do not open AudioWorklet).

**C# side (Arjun):**
- setIsPromptRunning in MainWindow.xaml.cs already fires when _isPromptRunning changes. Add a call to RcBridge.BroadcastStatus(busy) in that setter alongside the existing UI refresh.
- RcBridge.BroadcastStatus(bool busy) sends { "type": "rc_status", "status": busy ? "busy" : "idle" } to all connected WebSocket clients.

### Alignment with desktop PTT behavior

Desktop: _voiceStartedWithSendEnabled = _pttTargetTextBox == PromptTextBox && !_isPromptRunning — voice capture starts but "send on release" is disabled if a run is in progress. The mobile policy is strictly more conservative (no capture at all during a run), which is appropriate given the higher latency and lack of visual context on a phone.

## RC Mobile — Session Isolation Policy for Multi-Phone Connections (2026-04-30)

**By:** Orion Vale (Lead Architect)
**Status:** Decided

### Context

RemoteBridge allows multiple simultaneous WebSocket connections. When two phones are connected and both submit prompts, the question is whether they share one SquadBridge session (shared ddMessage history) or each get an isolated session.

The current handleRcStart implementation already answers this implicitly: onPrompt calls ridge.runPrompt(text, ..., { cwd: request.cwd, sessionId: request.sessionId }) using the **single ridge (SquadBridgeService singleton)** and the **single sessionId from the c_start request**. All phones share one session today.

### Decision: Shared session — intentional, no isolation needed

**All phone connections share a single SquadBridge session and conversation history.** This is the correct policy for SquadDash's use case and requires no code change to handleRcStart.

### Rationale

1. **Mental model: input devices, not independent users.** RC phones are remote controls for the same SquadDash instance. They are additional input surfaces for the same person, not separate users with separate contexts. Two phones connecting simultaneously means the same user switched devices or is testing — not two users having independent conversations.

2. **Consistent with the PTT-during-LLM-run policy.** The reject-with-feedback policy (Key Decision #4) already serialises prompts: only one prompt runs at a time. Shared session history is coherent because the AI always sees a sequential conversation thread, never concurrent interleaved prompts.

3. **ddMessage broadcast goes to all connected phones.** When a prompt comes in from any phone, cBridge.addMessage("user", text) broadcasts to all connected clients. The AI's response via ddMessage("agent", ...) also broadcasts to all. This creates a natural "shared screen" experience — all phones see the same conversation — which is the correct UX for a collaborative or multi-device household scenario.

4. **Isolated sessions would require significant architectural complexity for no benefit.** Per-connection isolation would require: a Map<connId, SquadBridgeSession>, per-connection session lifecycle (create on connect, destroy on disconnect with cleanup), per-connection message history (cannot broadcast ddMessage to all), and coordination with the _isPromptRunning guard across sessions. None of this aligns with the "phone as remote control" mental model.

### Implementation note

No code change is needed. The existing onPrompt wiring in handleRcStart correctly implements this policy:

`	s
onPrompt: async (text) => {
    rcBridge.addMessage("user", text);         // broadcast to ALL phones
    await bridge.runPrompt(text, handlers, {    // shared session
        cwd: request.cwd,
        sessionId: request.sessionId
    });
}
`

The only future consideration: if RemoteBridge gains a connId parameter on onPrompt, the handler should continue to ignore it (treat all connections as shared) unless a future explicit policy change is made.

# SquadDash Architectural Review — April 2026

**Reviewer:** Orion Vale, Lead Architect  
**Date:** 2026-04-17  
**Codebase Version:** Post-mainwindow decomposition (v0.9.1 era)  
**Test Suite Status:** 1,133 tests passing (all green)

---

## Executive Summary

SquadDash is a **Windows WPF desktop application** that provides a native UI for the Squad CLI — an AI agent coordination platform. The architecture is **sound and pragmatic**, with clear separation between the WPF presentation layer, C# backend services, and a TypeScript SDK bridge that shells out to the Node.js-based Squad CLI runtime.

**Overall Grade: B+**

The codebase has undergone significant **architectural refactoring** (MainWindow decomposition from 8,305 → 5,605 lines via extraction of 9 helper classes). The result is a well-organized, testable system with solid engineering discipline. Key strengths include comprehensive test coverage (1,133 passing tests), robust persistence patterns, and a clean bridge architecture between .NET and Node.js.

**Critical concerns:** MainWindow.xaml.cs remains large (5,605 lines), and the WPF code-behind pattern inherently limits testability for UI-intensive logic. The TypeScript bridge (`runPrompt.ts`) is also growing (700+ lines) and would benefit from decomposition. No major technical debt blockers exist, but continued vigilance on file size and responsibility boundaries is required.

## 1. Repository Structure & Organization

### Top-Level Layout

```
SquadDash-public/
├── SquadDash/              # Main WPF app (net10.0-windows) — 79,158 lines across 143 .cs files
├── SquadDash.Tests/        # NUnit test suite — 1,133 tests passing
├── SquadDashLauncher/      # Runtime slot launcher (hot-reload for debug builds)
├── Squad.SDK/              # TypeScript SDK bridge (@bradygaster/squad-sdk wrapper)
├── .squad/                 # Squad AI team config (agents, decisions, routing)
├── Run/                    # A/B runtime slot directories (deployment target)
├── installer/              # Inno Setup installer scripts
├── .github/workflows/      # CI/CD (build, test, squad heartbeat, triage)
├── global.json             # .NET 10 SDK pinning
├── squad-dash.slnx         # Solution file (3 projects)
└── package.json            # Root npm config (Squad CLI dev tooling)
```

**Assessment:** ✅ **Excellent.** Clear separation between app, tests, launcher, and SDK. The `.squad/` directory is a thoughtful convention for storing AI team metadata. The `Run/` slot system (A/B deployment) enables seamless hot-reload during development.

### Project Breakdown

| Project | Framework | Lines | Responsibility |
|---------|-----------|-------|----------------|
| `SquadDash` | net10.0-windows, WPF | 79,158 | Main UI, services, Squad CLI integration |
| `SquadDash.Tests` | net10.0-windows, NUnit | ~20,000 | Unit tests (1,133 tests) |
| `SquadDashLauncher` | net10.0-windows, console | <500 | Slot deployment & launcher |
| `Squad.SDK` | TypeScript (ESM) | ~1,500 | Node.js bridge to Squad CLI |

**Observations:**
- SquadDash is **by far the largest project** (143 .cs files, 79K lines). This is expected for a WPF application.
- SquadDash.Tests **links source files** from the main project (see `.csproj` `<Compile Include="...">`). This is a **pragmatic pattern** to avoid DLL boundary issues for internal classes but creates maintenance overhead (new files must be manually added to the test project).
- No shared libraries or cross-project references beyond the launcher. Each project is self-contained.

**Grade: A-**  
*Deduction: Test project file-linking is fragile and error-prone (easy to forget to add new files).*

## 2. Technology Stack & Dependencies

### .NET / C# Stack

| Component | Version | Notes |
|-----------|---------|-------|
| .NET SDK | 10.0.200-preview | Bleeding-edge (preview build); pinned via `global.json` |
| WPF | Built-in | Native Windows UI framework |
| NUnit | 4.4.0 | Test framework (modern, active) |
| Microsoft.CognitiveServices.Speech | 1.49.0 | Azure Speech SDK for push-to-talk |
| NAudio | 2.3.0 | Audio processing library |
| QRCoder | 1.6.0 | QR code generation (MIT license, approved for RC mobile) |

**Assessment:** ✅ **Modern and well-maintained.** The choice of .NET 10 preview is **aggressive but defensible** — the team is clearly comfortable with early adopter risk. All NuGet packages are recent and actively maintained.

**Concern:** .NET 10 is still in preview. The `rollForward: latestMinor` policy in `global.json` helps but may introduce breaking changes. Consider a **migration plan to .NET 10 RTM** once available.

### TypeScript / Node.js Stack

| Component | Version | Notes |
|-----------|---------|-------|
| TypeScript | 6.0.2 | Bleeding-edge (major version jump from 5.x) |
| @bradygaster/squad-sdk | 0.9.1 | Core Squad CLI SDK (external dependency) |
| Node.js | 20 LTS | Required at runtime (checked on startup) |
| ESLint | 10.1.0 | Linting (configured) |
| patch-package | 8.0.1 | Runtime patching for Windows compatibility |

**Assessment:** ⚠️ **Bleeding-edge with risks.** TypeScript 6.0.2 is **very new** (released 2024). The Squad SDK is at 0.9.1 (pre-1.0), signaling **API instability**. The use of `patch-package` indicates the team has already encountered compatibility issues with the upstream SDK.

**Concern:** The Squad SDK is a **hard external dependency** outside the team's control. The 0.9.x version suggests the API is not yet stable. A breaking change in the SDK would require immediate response.

**Recommendation:** Pin the Squad SDK to a **specific patch version** (e.g., `0.9.1` not `^0.9.1`) to prevent unexpected breakage. Monitor the Squad CLI release notes closely.

### Package Management

- **NuGet:** Standard .NET package management. No `packages.config` (modern PackageReference style). ✅
- **npm:** Two `package.json` files (root + Squad.SDK). Root is for tooling only (dev dependencies). SDK has 50+ transitive dependencies. ✅
- **Overrides:** `protobufjs: ^7.5.5` override in both package.json files (security fix for CVE-2023-36665). ✅ **Good hygiene.**

**Grade: B+**  
*Strengths: Modern package management, security awareness. Deductions: Bleeding-edge TypeScript and .NET versions, pre-1.0 external SDK dependency.*

---

## 3. Architecture Patterns

### Primary Pattern: WPF Code-Behind with Service Delegation

SquadDash **explicitly avoids MVVM** in favor of a **code-behind pattern with service extraction**. This is documented in `decisions.md` (2026-04-17):

> **Decision:** Extract into focused helper classes using constructor injection with `Action<>`/`Func<>` delegates. Preserve the existing code-behind pattern — no MVVM migration.
>
> **Rationale:** No ICommand/ViewModel infrastructure exists in the project. Introducing MVVM would multiply the change surface and require a parallel refactor of every data binding and event handler. Plain C# service objects with delegate injection achieve the same structural clarity (single responsibility, testable units) at a fraction of the risk.

**Pattern in Practice:**

```csharp
// MainWindow owns all state
private bool _isPromptRunning;
private AgentThreadRegistry _agentThreadRegistry;

// Helper class receives delegates, not state copies
var pec = new PromptExecutionController(
    executePrompt:    ExecutePromptAsync,
    getIsRunning:     () => _isPromptRunning,
    setIsRunning:     (val) => _isPromptRunning = val,
    syncAgentCards:   SyncAgentCards,
    // ... 40+ parameters
);
```

**Assessment:** This is a **pragmatic architectural decision**. MVVM introduces significant overhead (RelayCommand, ViewModels, PropertyChanged boilerplate) for a project that started as a simple UI wrapper. The delegate pattern achieves **testability** without the MVVM tax.

**Concerns:**
1. **PromptExecutionController has 40+ constructor parameters** (acknowledged as a code smell in history.md). This is a symptom of **incomplete decomposition** — the class still owns too many concerns.
2. **MainWindow remains at 5,605 lines** (down from 8,305, but still large). Many responsibilities remain in the god-object.

**Patterns Observed:**

| Pattern | Usage | Example |
|---------|-------|---------|
| Service Locator (legacy) | Being phased out | `WorkspacePaths` static (replaced by `IWorkspacePaths`) |
| Constructor Injection | Modern classes | `PromptExecutionController`, `AgentThreadRegistry` |
| Delegate Callbacks | UI orchestration | `Action<>`, `Func<>` for MainWindow sync |
| Observer (events) | SDK bridge | `SquadSdkProcess.EventReceived` |
| Repository (store pattern) | Persistence | `ApplicationSettingsStore`, `WorkspaceConversationStore` |
| Command Pattern | Host commands | `HostCommandRegistry`, `IHostCommandHandler` |

**Grade: B**  
*Strengths: Clear rationale for avoiding MVVM, service extraction underway. Deductions: MainWindow still too large, 40-parameter constructor anti-pattern.*

## 4. Layer Boundaries & Contracts

### Architectural Layers

└───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Key Contracts

#### 1. **IWorkspacePaths** (Infrastructure Contract)

```csharp
internal interface IWorkspacePaths {
    string ApplicationRoot { get; }
    string SquadSdkDirectory { get; }
    string RunRootDirectory { get; }
    string AgentImageAssetsDirectory { get; }
    string RoleIconAssetsDirectory { get; }
    string ScreenshotsDirectory { get; }
}
```

**Status:** ✅ **Well-designed.** Replaces the legacy `WorkspacePaths` static service locator. Migration is **partially complete** (20+ call sites remain on the static class per history.md).

#### 2. **SquadSdkProcess Bridge API**

- **Request Types:** `PromptRequest`, `DelegateRequest`, `NamedAgentRequest`, `AbortRequest`, `RunLoopRequest`, etc. (15+ types)
- **Event Stream:** `SquadSdkEvent` with 100+ properties (covers all event types from the SDK)
- **Communication:** Stdin/stdout via NDJSON (newline-delimited JSON)

**Assessment:** ⚠️ **Event class is a God Object.** `SquadSdkEvent.cs` has **142 lines and 114 properties**. This is a **discriminated union masquerading as a POCO**. Different event types use different subsets of properties (e.g., `RcPort` only for `rc_started`, `LoopIteration` only for `loop_iteration`).

**Alternative:** Use a **base class + derived event types** or a **union type** (requires C# 10+ discriminated unions proposal). The current design works but is **semantically unclear**.

#### 3. **Host Command System**

```csharp
internal sealed class HostCommandRegistry {
    IReadOnlyList<HostCommandDescriptor> GetCommands(string? workspaceFolder);
    ValidationResult Validate(HostCommandInvocation, HostCommandDescriptor);
    string BuildCatalogInstruction(string? workspaceFolder);
}

internal interface IHostCommandHandler {
    Task<HostCommandResult> ExecuteAsync(HostCommandInvocation invocation);
}
```

**Status:** ✅ **Excellent.** Clean extensibility model. Built-in commands (start_loop, stop_loop, open_panel, etc.) + optional workspace-specific extensions loaded from `.squad/host-commands.json`. Commands can inject results back into the AI context (e.g., `get_queue_status`).

#### 4. **Store Persistence Contracts**

All stores follow the **same atomic-write pattern**:

```csharp
// 1. Acquire cross-process mutex
using var mutex = AcquireMutex();

// 2. Load current state
var current = LoadCore();

// 3. Modify snapshot
var updated = current with { ... };

// 4. Atomic write via temp file
JsonFileStorage.AtomicWrite(path, updated);
```

**Stores:** `ApplicationSettingsStore`, `WorkspaceConversationStore`, `PromptHistoryStore`, `RestartCoordinatorStateStore`, `RuntimeSlotStateStore`.

**Assessment:** ✅ **Robust and consistent.** The pattern is **duplicated 5 times** (noted in history.md as technical debt) but is correct. The use of **mutex-protected atomic writes** prevents corruption in multi-instance scenarios.

**Concern (from history.md):**
> 5 store classes each duplicate the same atomic-write boilerplate. Pattern: write .tmp → copy/move to final. Mutex strategy varies by store.

**Recommendation:** Extract a **generic `AtomicStore<T>` base class** to eliminate duplication. The `JsonFileStorage.AtomicWrite` helper is a good start but doesn't cover the mutex logic.

### Layer Violations

**Found 1 violation (already fixed):**

> Layer violation: WorkspaceConversationStore.NormalizeTurn called ToolTranscriptFormatter.BuildDetailContent in the inferred-completion branch. Root cause: DetailContent is persisted to JSON, so the store needed to build it, but reached into the display layer to do so.

**Fix applied:** Created `ToolTranscriptData.cs` (data layer) with `ToolTranscriptDetailContent.Build()` method. Both store and formatter now call the data-layer method. ✅

**Grade: A-**  
*Strengths: Clean layering, well-defined contracts, robust bridge architecture. Deductions: SquadSdkEvent god-object, store pattern duplication.*

---

## 5. Code Quality Signals

### Structural Quality

**Positive Signals:**
- ✅ **Nullable reference types enabled** (`<Nullable>enable</Nullable>`) — reduces null-reference bugs
- ✅ **Implicit usings enabled** — reduces boilerplate
- ✅ **Consistent naming conventions** (PascalCase for public, _camelCase for private fields)
- ✅ **XML doc comments on public APIs** (e.g., `PromptExecutionController`, `IWorkspacePaths`)
- ✅ **Minimal file-scoped namespaces** in newer files (e.g., `namespace SquadDash;`)
- ✅ **Constants for magic values** (e.g., `MultiLineHintCooldown`, `MaxRecentFolders`)

**Negative Signals:**
- ⚠️ **Large files:** MainWindow.xaml.cs (5,605 lines), runPrompt.ts (~700 lines)
- ⚠️ **40-parameter constructor** in PromptExecutionController (acknowledged code smell)
- ⚠️ **Mutable public collections** in extracted classes (partially fixed per DEL-2 completion in history.md)

### Error Handling

**Pattern observed:**

```csharp
// App.xaml.cs — Global exception handlers
DispatcherUnhandledException += App_DispatcherUnhandledException;
AppDomain.CurrentDomain.UnhandledException += CurrentDomain_UnhandledException;
TaskScheduler.UnobservedTaskException += TaskScheduler_UnobservedTaskException;

// Emergency save on crash
private void TryEmergencySave() {
    try {
        if (MainWindow is MainWindow w)
            w.Dispatcher.Invoke(w.EmergencySave);
    }
    catch (Exception ex) {
        SquadDashTrace.Write("Unhandled", $"TryEmergencySave failed: {ex.Message}");
    }
}
```

**Assessment:** ✅ **Excellent.** The app has **comprehensive crash recovery**:
- Global exception handlers at 3 levels (Dispatcher, AppDomain, TaskScheduler)
- **Emergency save** on unhandled exceptions (prevents data loss)
- **Graceful degradation** (e.g., swallow `ObjectDisposedException` from disposed CancellationTokenSources)

**Logging:** All critical paths log to `SquadDashTrace.Write(category, message)`. Trace window available in UI for live diagnostics. ✅

### Security

**Positive:**
- ✅ **No hardcoded credentials** (Azure Speech keys stored in user settings, not source)
- ✅ **Cross-process locking** via named mutexes (prevents workspace corruption)
- ✅ **Atomic file writes** (prevents partial-write corruption)
- ✅ **Security overrides** in package.json (`protobufjs: ^7.5.5` for CVE fix)

**Concerns:**
- ⚠️ **Push notification secrets** (Phase 2) will need DPAPI or environment variables (already flagged in history.md)
- ⚠️ **No input sanitization** visible for file paths (assumes Windows path validation is sufficient)

**Grade: A-**  
*Strengths: Robust error handling, comprehensive logging, crash recovery. Deductions: Large files, 40-param constructor.*

---

## 6. Testing Architecture

### Test Suite Structure

```
SquadDash.Tests/
├── 1,133 tests (all passing)
├── NUnit 4.4.0
├── File linking pattern (136 linked source files from SquadDash/)
└── Test coverage for:
    - Helper classes: ✅ ColorUtilities, AgentThreadRegistry, BackgroundTaskPresenter, TranscriptConversationManager
    - Stores: ✅ ApplicationSettingsStore, WorkspaceConversationStore, PromptHistoryStore
    - Services: ✅ LoopController, PromptQueue, HostCommandExecutor, IntelliSenseController
    - Parsers: ✅ LoopMdParser, TasksPanelParser, QuickReplyOptionParser
    - Policies: ✅ AgentRosterVisibilityPolicy, RoutingIssueWorkflow, BackgroundWorkClassifier
```

**Test Metrics:**
- **1,133 tests passing** (0 failures)
- **Suite runtime:** ~6 seconds (fast)
- **Coverage gaps (known):** MarkdownDocumentRenderer, PromptExecutionController (require WPF dispatcher — noted in history.md as deferred)

**Assessment:** ✅ **Excellent test discipline.** The suite is **comprehensive, fast, and green**. The team **added 46 tests** for the 9 extracted helper classes immediately after refactoring (per DEL-1 in history.md).

### Testability Patterns

**Observed patterns:**

1. **Constructor injection** — Helper classes accept all dependencies via constructor, making them trivially mockable
2. **Pure functions** — Utilities like `ColorUtilities`, parsers, and policies are side-effect-free
3. **Abstraction via delegates** — Helper classes don't depend on MainWindow (they receive `Action<>`/`Func<>` instead)
4. **Test fixtures** — `TestWorkspace.cs` provides isolated temp directories for file-based tests

**Example (from ColorUtilitiesTests.cs):**

```csharp
[Test]
public void RgbToHsl_Red_ReturnsZeroHue() {
    var (h, s, l) = ColorUtilities.RgbToHsl(255, 0, 0);
    Assert.That(h, Is.EqualTo(0).Within(0.01));
    Assert.That(s, Is.EqualTo(1).Within(0.01));
    Assert.That(l, Is.EqualTo(0.5).Within(0.01));
}
```

**Concerns:**
- ⚠️ **Test project requires manual file linking** (every new source file must be added to `.csproj`). This is error-prone.
- ⚠️ **WPF-dependent logic is hard to test** (MarkdownDocumentRenderer, PromptExecutionController). The team deferred these tests but acknowledged the gap.

**Grade: A**  
*Strengths: Comprehensive coverage, fast suite, disciplined test-first culture. Deduction: WPF test gaps.*

---

## 7. Deployment & Configuration

### Build & Deployment

**Build System:**
- **.NET SDK 10.0** (preview)
- **MSBuild targets:** Custom targets in `SquadDash.csproj` for:
  - Git commit count → version number (`AppVersion.g.cs`)
  - Speech SDK native DLL flattening (P/Invoke fix)
  - Run-slot deployment (Debug builds only)

**Hot-Reload System:**

```
SquadDash.App.exe (main binary)
      ↓
SquadDash.exe (launcher)
      ↓ reads Run/active-slot.json
      ↓ spawns Run/A/SquadDash.App.exe or Run/B/SquadDash.App.exe
      
On rebuild:
1. Build writes to inactive slot (B)
2. Launcher exe calls --deploy-build-output
3. Launcher updates active-slot.json → B
4. Next launch uses Run/B/
```

**Assessment:** ✅ **Innovative.** The A/B slot system enables **zero-downtime rebuilds** during development. This is a **non-standard but effective pattern** for desktop apps.

### Configuration Management

**Configuration Layers:**

1. **Global (machine-wide):** `%LocalAppData%\SquadDash\settings.json`
   - User name, API keys, theme, recent folders
   - Managed by `ApplicationSettingsStore`

2. **Workspace-specific:** `%LocalAppData%\SquadDash\workspaces\<hash>\conversation.json`
   - Conversation history, session state, turn records
   - Managed by `WorkspaceConversationStore`

3. **Squad SDK session config:** `%LocalAppData%\SquadDash\workspaces\<hash>\sdk-config\`
   - Squad CLI runtime state (opaque to SquadDash)

**Assessment:** ✅ **Well-organized.** Clear separation between global and workspace-specific settings. The use of **hashed workspace paths** prevents collisions.

### Installer

```
installer/
├── SquadDash.iss    (Inno Setup script)
└── build-installer.ps1
```

**Assessment:** ⚠️ **Minimal but functional.** Inno Setup is a standard choice for Windows installers. No Chocolatey, WinGet, or MSI installer observed. Acceptable for early-stage project.

### CI/CD

```yaml
# .github/workflows/ci.yml
jobs:
  build-and-test:
    runs-on: windows-latest
    steps:
      - Checkout
      - Setup .NET 10.0.x
      - Setup Node 20 (with npm cache)
      - dotnet restore
      - dotnet build --no-incremental
      - dotnet test --verbosity normal
```

**Assessment:** ✅ **Simple and effective.** The CI pipeline is **minimal but sufficient**:
- Runs on every push/PR to `main`
- Verifies build + test suite (1,133 tests)
- Caches npm dependencies

**Additional workflows:**
- `squad-heartbeat.yml` — Squad AI team health check
- `squad-issue-assign.yml` — Auto-assign issues to Squad agents
- `squad-triage.yml` — Auto-triage new issues
- `sync-squad-labels.yml` — Sync GitHub labels with Squad team structure

**Grade: B+**  
*Strengths: Innovative hot-reload, robust config management, functional CI. Deductions: No MSI/Chocolatey installer, minimal CI (no code coverage metrics, no publish step).*

## 8. Risks & Concerns

### Critical Risks

| # | Risk | Severity | Mitigation Status |
|---|------|----------|-------------------|
| **R1** | **.NET 10 preview instability** | HIGH | Pin SDK version via `global.json`; monitor for RTM |
| **R2** | **Squad SDK 0.9.x breaking changes** | HIGH | Pin to patch version (`0.9.1` not `^0.9.1`) |
| **R3** | **MainWindow still 5,605 lines** | MEDIUM | Ongoing decomposition (40% reduction achieved) |
| **R4** | **PromptExecutionController 40-param constructor** | MEDIUM | Deferred pending DEL-2/3/4 completion |
| **R5** | **No test coverage for WPF-heavy classes** | MEDIUM | Deferred (requires dispatcher seam) |
| **R6** | **Store pattern duplication (5 classes)** | LOW | Acknowledged tech debt; low priority |
| **R7** | **SquadSdkEvent god-object (114 properties)** | LOW | Works but semantically unclear |

### Technical Debt (from history.md)

**Backlog items:**

1. **DEL-3:** Migrate `_isPromptRunning` ownership to `PromptExecutionController` (assigned to Lyra Morn) — **IN PROGRESS**
2. **DEL-5:** Reduce `TranscriptConversationManager` leaky setters (assigned to Lyra Morn) — **IN PROGRESS**
3. **Store boilerplate extraction** (no owner assigned) — **DEFERRED**
4. **Markdown duplication cleanup** (MainWindow still has AppendInlineMarkdown, TryReadMarkdownLink, etc.) — **DEFERRED**

**Assessment:** ✅ Technical debt is **documented and tracked**. The team uses a **squad-driven workflow** (.squad/decisions.md, .squad/agents/, .squad/tasks.md) to manage architectural evolution.

### Security Concerns

1. **Push notification secrets (Phase 2):** Ntfy.sh requires no secrets, but Pushover/Twilio will. Recommendation: Use **DPAPI** or **Azure Key Vault** (flagged in history.md). ⚠️
2. **No code signing:** Installer is unsigned (Windows SmartScreen warnings). ⚠️
3. **Node.js dependency:** App shells out to `node`, `npm`, `npx` at runtime — requires user trust in Node.js supply chain. ⚠️

### Performance Concerns

**None observed.** The architecture is **async-first** (`Task`-based APIs everywhere), and the test suite runs in 6 seconds. No evidence of performance bottlenecks.

### Scalability Concerns

**Conversation store limits:**
- Max turns: 200
- Max agent threads: 80
- Retention: 14 days

**Assessment:** ✅ These limits are **reasonable for a desktop app**. The store will auto-prune old data to prevent unbounded growth.

**Grade: B**  
*Strengths: Well-documented risks, tracked tech debt. Deductions: High-severity external dependencies (.NET 10 preview, Squad SDK pre-1.0).*

---

## 9. Recommendations

### Immediate (Next Sprint)

1. **Pin Squad SDK to exact version** (`"@bradygaster/squad-sdk": "0.9.1"` not `^0.9.1`)  
   **Rationale:** Pre-1.0 dependency; API instability risk is high.

2. **Extract generic `AtomicStore<T>` base class**  
   **Rationale:** Eliminate boilerplate duplication across 5 store classes.  
   **Files:** `ApplicationSettingsStore`, `WorkspaceConversationStore`, `PromptHistoryStore`, `RestartCoordinatorStateStore`, `RuntimeSlotStateStore`

3. **Complete DEL-3 (migrate `_isPromptRunning` to PEC)**  
   **Rationale:** Already assigned to Lyra Morn; reduces MainWindow field count.

### Short-Term (Next 3 Months)

4. **Decompose `runPrompt.ts` (700+ lines)**  
   **Rationale:** TypeScript bridge is growing; extract request handlers into separate modules.  
   **Suggestion:** `handlers/promptHandler.ts`, `handlers/loopHandler.ts`, `handlers/rcHandler.ts`

5. **Replace `SquadSdkEvent` god-object with discriminated union**  
   **Rationale:** 114 properties in a single class obscures which properties are valid for each event type.  
   **Suggestion:** Use C# 10+ discriminated unions or base + derived event classes.

6. **Add code coverage metrics to CI**  
   **Rationale:** 1,133 tests but no visibility into actual coverage percentage.  
   **Tool:** `dotnet test --collect:"XPlat Code Coverage"` + Coverlet + Codecov.io

7. **Migrate to .NET 10 RTM when available**  
   **Rationale:** Preview SDK is a deployment risk; RTM will be more stable.

### Long-Term (Next 6-12 Months)

8. **Extract WPF-specific logic into testable presenters**  
   **Rationale:** MarkdownDocumentRenderer and PromptExecutionController are untested due to WPF dispatcher dependency.  
   **Pattern:** MVP (Model-View-Presenter) or thin WPF adapter over testable business logic.

9. **Consider MVVM migration for new features**  
   **Rationale:** Code-behind is pragmatic for legacy code but limits testability. New features (e.g., preferences panels) would benefit from MVVM.  
   **Constraint:** Do not retrofit existing code; apply MVVM only to greenfield work.

10. **Add code signing certificate**  
    **Rationale:** Eliminate Windows SmartScreen warnings for installer.

11. **Publish to Chocolatey and/or WinGet**  
    **Rationale:** Improve discoverability and installation experience.

### Research Items

12. **Evaluate TypeScript 5.x LTS** (downgrade from 6.0.2)  
    **Rationale:** TypeScript 6.0 is very new; 5.x has broader ecosystem support.  
    **Action:** Assess breaking changes before deciding.

13. **Monitor Squad CLI roadmap**  
    **Rationale:** SquadDash is tightly coupled to Squad SDK API. A major Squad CLI refactor would impact SquadDash.  
    **Action:** Establish communication channel with Squad CLI maintainers.

---

## 10. Final Assessment

### Strengths

1. ✅ **Comprehensive test suite** (1,133 tests, all green)
2. ✅ **Clean layer separation** (WPF → Services → Bridge → Squad SDK)
3. ✅ **Robust persistence** (atomic writes, mutex-protected, crash recovery)
4. ✅ **Pragmatic architectural decisions** (code-behind over MVVM, documented rationale)
5. ✅ **Strong engineering discipline** (nullable types, logging, error handling, CI)
6. ✅ **Innovative hot-reload system** (A/B slots for zero-downtime rebuilds)

### Weaknesses

1. ⚠️ **External dependency risk** (.NET 10 preview, Squad SDK 0.9.x pre-1.0)
2. ⚠️ **Large files** (MainWindow 5,605 lines, runPrompt.ts ~700 lines)
3. ⚠️ **Constructor parameter explosion** (PromptExecutionController 40 params)
4. ⚠️ **Test gaps** (WPF-heavy classes deferred)
5. ⚠️ **Store pattern duplication** (5 classes with identical mutex/atomic-write logic)

### Overall Grade: **B+**

**Summary:** SquadDash is a **well-architected, pragmatic system** with solid engineering practices. The recent decomposition effort (MainWindow 8,305 → 5,605 lines) demonstrates **architectural hygiene and discipline**. The test suite is exemplary. The bridge architecture is clean and extensible.

**Primary risk:** External dependency on pre-1.0 Squad CLI and .NET 10 preview. These are **manageable but require vigilance**.

**Recommended trajectory:** Continue decomposition (MainWindow target: <4,000 lines), extract store boilerplate, pin Squad SDK version, and add code coverage metrics. The system is **production-ready** for early adopters but should stabilize external dependencies before general release.

# Decision: AI Command System Architecture

**Proposed By:** Orion Vale (Lead Architect)  
**Date:** 2026-05-01  
**Status:** Inbox - Awaiting Review  
**Impact:** High (affects command extension, AI integration reliability)

## Problem

The SquadDash AI-to-app command system has no centralized architecture:

1. **Documentation Injection (Loop-Only)**: Commands documented only within loop execution context (LoopController.cs:160-198 BuildAugmentedPrompt), not globally available to AI
2. **Fragile Parsing**: ExtractSquadashPayload uses regex instead of System.Text.Json for command extraction
3. **No Command Registry**: No discoverable registry, no metadata structure, no scope management
4. **Single Command Per Response**: Can only extract first matching command; multiple commands not supported
5. **Scattered Implementation**: Commands hardcoded in MainWindow.xaml.cs (stop_loop, start_loop at lines 3842, 3854)

## Recommended Solution

Implement **Unified CommandRegistry Pattern**:

```csharp
public enum CommandScope { Global, LoopOnly, BatchOnly }

public class CommandDefinition
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public CommandScope Scope { get; set; }
    public List<CommandParameter> Parameters { get; set; }
    public string Documentation { get; set; }
}

public interface ICommandRegistry
{
    void Register(CommandDefinition definition, Func<CommandContext, Task> handler);
    IEnumerable<CommandDefinition> GetDiscoverableCommands(CommandScope scope);
    Task<IEnumerable<CommandResult>> ExtractAndExecuteCommands(string aiResponse, CommandContext context);
}
```

## Benefits

- **Discoverability**: AI can query available commands per scope at loop start
- **Robustness**: JSON-based extraction replaces fragile regex
- **Extensibility**: Unified interface for new command addition
- **Multi-Command**: Support multiple commands per AI response
- **Documentation**: Commands self-document via registry metadata

## Related Items

- Command locations: MainWindow.xaml.cs:3842, MainWindow.xaml.cs:3854
- Parser: PushNotificationService.ExtractSquadashPayload (uses regex)
- Doc injection: LoopController.cs:160-198


# Test Suite Analysis — 2026-05-01

**Author:** Vesper Knox  
**Date:** 2026-05-01  
**Status:** Two test failures identified; no production code bugs

---

## Test Run Summary

**Total:** 1041 tests  
**Passed:** 1038  
**Failed:** 2  
**Skipped:** 0  
**Duration:** ~7.3 seconds

---

## Failures

### 1. VoiceInsertionHeuristicsTests.IsRightContextRequiresTrailingSpace_StartsWithComma_ReturnsTrue

**Location:** `SquadDash.Tests\VoiceInsertionHeuristicsTests.cs:328`

**Failure:**
```
Assert.That(VoiceInsertionHeuristics.IsRightContextRequiresTrailingSpace(", which"), Is.True)
  Expected: True
  But was:  False
```

**Root Cause:**  
Production code (`VoiceInsertionHeuristics.cs:252`) explicitly excludes commas from requiring trailing space:
```csharp
return rightContext.Length > 0
    && rightContext[0] != ')'
    && ".,;!?:".IndexOf(rightContext[0]) < 0  // comma is in the exclusion list
    && !char.IsWhiteSpace(rightContext[0]);
```

This is **intentional behavior** documented in the method's XML comment: "The punctuation exception prevents `"word ,rest"` — punctuation attaches to the word on its left, not the word on its right."

**Diagnosis:** Test is wrong. Production code correctly implements the documented specification.

**Recommended Action:** Update test to expect `false`, or if requirements changed, remove comma from the exclusion list and update the doc comment.

---

### 2. WorkspaceConversationStoreTests.Save_SortsTurnsChronologicallyBeforePersisting

**Location:** `SquadDash.Tests\WorkspaceConversationStoreTests.cs:228`

**Failure:**
```
Multiple failures or warnings in test:
  1) Assert.That(savedPrompts, Is.EqualTo(new[] { "Show me Lyra's full plan", "/tasks" }))
     Expected is <System.String[2]>, actual is <System.String[0]>
     Missing:  < "Show me Lyra's full plan", "/tasks" >

  2) Assert.That(loadedPrompts, Is.EqualTo(new[] { "Show me Lyra's full plan", "/tasks" }))
     Expected is <System.String[2]>, actual is <System.String[0]>
     Missing:  < "Show me Lyra's full plan", "/tasks" >
```

**Root Cause:**  
Test creates turn records with a hardcoded timestamp from April 16, 2026:
```csharp
var promptStartedAt = new DateTimeOffset(2026, 4, 16, 17, 45, 0, TimeSpan.FromHours(-4));
```

`WorkspaceConversationStore.NormalizeState` applies a **14-day retention window**:
```csharp
var cutoff = now - RetentionPeriod;  // RetentionPeriod = TimeSpan.FromDays(14)
var turns = state.Turns.Where(turn => turn.Timestamp >= cutoff) // ...
```

Since the test runs in late 2024/early 2025, the April 2026 date is **in the past** relative to `now`, making the turns more than 14 days old. They're filtered out during normalization, resulting in an empty `Turns` array.

**Diagnosis:** Test data is stale. This is a test hygiene issue, not a production code bug.

**Recommended Action:** Replace hardcoded 2026 timestamps with relative dates:
```csharp
var promptStartedAt = DateTimeOffset.UtcNow.AddMinutes(-5);
var localCommandStartedAt = promptStartedAt.AddMinutes(1);
```

---

## Pattern Identified

Both failures are **test maintenance issues**, not production code defects:
1. Test expectations out of sync with documented production behavior
2. Test fixtures using stale hardcoded dates instead of relative timestamps

**Recommendation for Vesper Knox workflow:**
- When writing new tests, prefer `DateTimeOffset.UtcNow.Add*` over hardcoded future dates
- Keep test assertions aligned with production code doc comments
- Run the full suite periodically (e.g., before major releases) to catch drift

# Quality Audit Results — 2025-01-18

**Auditor:** Vesper Knox (Testing & Quality Specialist)  
**Scope:** Full SquadDash-public repository verification (build, test, code quality, coverage)

---

## Executive Summary

**Build:** SquadDash.Tests compiles successfully. Main SquadDash project has non-critical deployment step failure (not C# compilation error).  
**Tests:** 1133 passed, 0 failed, 1 skipped (1134 total) — all critical tests passing.  
**Code Quality:** Generally strong. 1 nullable warning (false positive), 34 bare catch blocks (mostly acceptable cleanup paths), 1 TODO comment.  
**Coverage:** Strong core coverage (stores, parsers, policies). Notable gaps in newer features (CommitApprovalStore, DocStatusStore, DocTopicsLoader, LoopOutputStore) and UI/Windows layers.

---

## Critical Findings

### 🔴 High Priority — Missing Test Coverage

**CommitApprovalStore** (`SquadDash\CommitApprovalStore.cs`)  
- **Risk:** JSON persistence + capping logic (200 items, ordered by TurnStartedAt) untested
- **Impact:** Approval tracking is a user-visible feature; data loss/corruption would require manual recovery
- **Recommendation:** Create `CommitApprovalStoreTests.cs` covering Load (empty file, malformed JSON, cap overflow), Save (atomic write, ordering)

**DocStatusStore** (`SquadDash\DocStatusStore.cs`)  
- **Risk:** Case-insensitive key lookup, "was ever approved" tracking, approval/unapproval state transitions untested
- **Impact:** Documentation approval workflow correctness; edge cases in path normalization could cause status loss
- **Recommendation:** Create `DocStatusStoreTests.cs` covering GetStatus, SetApproved/SetNeedsReview, WasEverApproved, case-insensitivity, forward-slash normalization

**DocTopicsLoader** (`SquadDash\DocTopicsLoader.cs`)  
- **Risk:** SUMMARY.md parsing (regex-based link extraction), folder scanning fallback, first-item selection untested
- **Impact:** Broken parsing could hide documentation; incorrect first-item selection affects UX
- **Recommendation:** Create `DocTopicsLoaderTests.cs` covering SUMMARY.md line parsing, folder scan, null/missing docs folder handling

**LoopOutputStore** (`SquadDash\LoopOutputStore.cs`)  
- **Risk:** Sequential log numbering (loop-output-001.log, 002, ...) untested
- **Impact:** Log collisions or gaps would confuse debugging; disk-full scenarios unhandled
- **Recommendation:** Create `LoopOutputStoreTests.cs` covering SaveLog (sequential numbering, whitespace-only content rejection, directory creation)

---

## Medium Priority

### ⚠️ Code Quality Issues

**Nullable Warning (False Positive)**  
- **Location:** `MainWindow.xaml.cs:7250` — CS8602: Dereference of a possibly null reference
- **Analysis:** `newFilePath` assigned at line 7144 (`Path.Combine(...)`) and never reassigned; guaranteed non-null at usage sites (7250, 7255)
- **Action:** Suppress warning with `#pragma warning disable CS8602` or use null-forgiving operator `newFilePath!` if preferred

**Bare Catch Blocks**  
- **Count:** 34 instances across codebase
- **Analysis:** Majority are in cleanup/disposal paths (SpeechRecognitionService, RemoteSpeechSession, ScreenshotOverlayWindow) where exceptions are non-critical. Three instances in DocStatusStore (lines 39, 87, 106) silently swallow JSON parse failures and file write errors — acceptable for best-effort persistence but should be logged if diagnosing issues.
- **Action:** Consider adding trace logging to DocStatusStore catch blocks to aid debugging without changing behavior

**TODO Comment**  
- **Location:** `ScreenshotRefreshRunner.cs:172` — "TODO: iterate twice for Both (capture -light and -dark variants separately)"
- **Analysis:** Screenshot system deferred feature; not blocking
- **Action:** Track as future enhancement (not urgent)

---

## What's Working Well ✅

- **Test Suite Health:** 1134 tests, 99.9% pass rate (1 skipped assumption in SquadInstallationStateServiceTests is acceptable)
- **Test Quality:** No empty test bodies, no TODO markers in tests, strong NUnit 4.4.0 compliance
- **Core Coverage:** Excellent coverage of stores (ApplicationSettings, PromptHistory, RuntimeSlotState, WorkspaceConversation), parsers (LoopMd, QuickReplyOption, StartupFolder, TasksPanel), policies (AgentThreadIdentity, QuickReplyAgentLaunch, SilentBackgroundAgent)
- **SDK Bridge:** SquadSdkProcess serialization/deserialization fully tested
- **Error Handling:** Generally defensive; most bare catch blocks are in non-critical cleanup paths

---

## Recommended Actions (Prioritized)

1. **URGENT:** Create test coverage for `CommitApprovalStore` (user-visible feature, data persistence risk)
2. **HIGH:** Create test coverage for `DocStatusStore` (approval workflow correctness)
3. **HIGH:** Create test coverage for `DocTopicsLoader` (documentation navigation UX)
4. **MEDIUM:** Create test coverage for `LoopOutputStore` (debugging aid, log integrity)
5. **LOW:** Suppress or annotate nullable warning at MainWindow.xaml.cs:7250 (compiler false-positive)
6. **LOW:** Consider adding trace logging to DocStatusStore catch blocks (aid debugging without behavior change)
7. **DEFERRED:** Track ScreenshotRefreshRunner TODO as future enhancement

---

**Conclusion:** Codebase is in good overall health. Test suite is robust and well-maintained. Primary risk area is newer features (commit approvals, doc status tracking, doc topics loading) lacking test coverage. Recommend prioritizing test coverage for data-persistence components before production release.


# Loop Panel Splitter Layout Pattern

**Date:** 2026-04-27  
**Author:** Lyra Morn  
**Status:** Implemented  
**Commit:** 9b9d756  

## Decision

When a panel section needs internal resizing via GridSplitter but should maintain fixed positioning in the outer layout grid, wrap the resizable elements in a dedicated inner Grid instead of using outer-grid columns for each element.

## Context

The loop panel area in MainWindow required three elements: loop controls (LoopPanelBorder), a resizable splitter, and loop output (LoopOutputBorder). The original design placed all three as siblings in the outer StatusAgentPanelsGrid with columns 3, 4, and 5. The GridSplitter used `ResizeBehavior="PreviousAndNext"` which caused dragging to resize BOTH the loop controls (col 3) and output (col 5) — not the desired behavior.

## Implementation

Created `LoopSectionGrid` as a single outer grid column (Grid.Column="3") containing:
- **Inner Column 0:** `LoopPanelInnerColDef` Width="Auto" — LoopPanelBorder
- **Inner Column 1:** Width="5" — GridSplitter with `ResizeBehavior="PreviousAndNext"`
- **Inner Column 2:** Width="280" — LoopOutputBorder

When loop output becomes visible, freeze the loop controls column:
```csharp
LoopPanelInnerColDef.MaxWidth = LoopPanelBorder.ActualWidth;
LoopPanelInnerColDef.Width = new GridLength(LoopPanelBorder.ActualWidth);
```

When hiding output, restore Auto sizing:
```csharp
LoopPanelInnerColDef.MaxWidth = double.PositiveInfinity;
LoopPanelInnerColDef.Width = GridLength.Auto;
```

This ensures:
1. The splitter only resizes the output panel (col 2), not the controls (col 0)
2. The loop section as a whole maintains its outer grid position
3. The controls panel can auto-size to content when output is hidden

## Benefits

- **User control:** Splitter behaves predictably — only the output panel resizes
- **Layout stability:** Loop controls maintain consistent width during drag
- **Clean column structure:** Reduced outer grid from 10 columns to 8
- **Reusable pattern:** Same technique can apply to other resizable panel pairs

## Alternative Considered

We considered using `ResizeBehavior="BasedOnAlignment"` with carefully tuned `HorizontalAlignment` values, but this approach is fragile and doesn't guarantee the controls panel stays fixed-width during drag.

## Related Changes

- Removed outer `LoopOutputSplitterColumnDef` and `LoopOutputColumnDef`
- Decremented Grid.Column for all panels after the loop section (TasksPanel, WatchPanel, ApprovalPanel, NotesPanel)
- Added context menu items for show/hide loop output
- Updated `SyncLoopOutputPane()` to manage column freeze/unfreeze logic

## Files Modified

- `SquadDash/MainWindow.xaml` — Grid column restructure, inner LoopSectionGrid
- `SquadDash/MainWindow.xaml.cs` — SyncLoopOutputPane freeze logic, context menu handlers

# Decision: Diff Hover Popup Implementation

**Date:** 2027-01-02  
**Author:** Lyra Morn (WPF & UI Specialist)  
**Status:** Implemented  
**Commit:** 52a9735c771cfdbf728b2a3d05a5d41004995d4d

## Context

Users needed a quick way to preview file changes when hovering over edit tool entries in the transcript, without needing to expand the entry or open a separate window.

## Decision

Implemented a hover-triggered diff popup that appears when the mouse enters the header panel of an edit tool transcript entry. The popup displays a syntax-highlighted unified diff with:

- **Added lines:** Blue foreground (`DiffAddedText`) with ~15% opacity blue background
- **Removed lines:** Red foreground (`DiffRemovedText`) with ~15% opacity red background
- **Context lines:** Normal foreground, no background tint
- **Header lines:** Dimmed/muted appearance
- **Monospace font:** Consolas 12px for code readability
- **Truncation:** Max 40 lines displayed with scroll support up to 300px height
- **Theme-aware:** Uses existing theme resources for colors

## Implementation Details

### New File: `DiffHoverPopup.cs`
- `DiffLineKind` enum for line type classification
- `DiffLine` class to represent parsed diff lines
- `DiffHoverPopup` class extending WPF `Popup`
- `ParseDiff()` static method using prefix-based parsing (same approach as existing `TryBuildEditDiffSummary()`)
- `ShowDiff()` method to build and display the popup UI

### Modified: `MainWindow.xaml.cs`
- Added hover event handlers in `CreateToolEntry()` method
- Only wires events for edit tool entries (`descriptor.ToolName == "edit"`)
- Checks entry is completed before showing popup
- Uses `headerPanel.MouseEnter` and `headerPanel.MouseLeave` for trigger/dismiss

## Alternatives Considered

1. **Using WPF ToolTip:** Rejected because ToolTip has limited styling control and doesn't work well with scrollable content
2. **Creating a separate window:** Rejected as too heavyweight for a quick preview
3. **Expanding entry by default:** Rejected as it breaks the compact transcript view

## Theme Resources Used

- `DiffAddedText` — Blue color for added lines
- `DiffRemovedText` — Red color for removed lines
- `CardSurface` — Popup background
- `LineColor` — Border color
- `SubtleText` — Header line text
- `LabelText` — Context line text

All resources already exist in both Dark.xaml and Light.xaml, ensuring theme consistency.

## Build Status

Clean build — DLL compiled successfully. (Launcher copy failed due to app running, which is expected.)

## Future Enhancements

- Could add syntax highlighting for specific file types (currently treats all as plain text)
- Could add side-by-side diff view option
- Could make max lines/height configurable via preferences

# RevisionPendingIndicator/RevisionHighlightAdorner TextBox Compatibility

**Date:** 2027-01-02  
**Decided by:** Lyra Morn  
**Status:** Blocked — requires design decision

## Context

Task specification requested wiring `RevisionPendingIndicator` and `RevisionHighlightAdorner` into `MarkdownDocumentWindow.cs` → `TriggerReviseWithAi()` method to show inline progress indicator and highlight during AI revision.

## Problem

- `RevisionPendingIndicator.Insert()` signature: `static RevisionPendingIndicator? Insert(RichTextBox rtb, int afterCharOffset)`
- `RevisionHighlightAdorner.Attach()` signature: `static RevisionHighlightAdorner? Attach(RichTextBox rtb, int startOffset, int length)`
- `MarkdownDocumentWindow` uses `TextBox` for editing (line 1585: `public TextBox EditorTextBox { get; }`)
- `TriggerReviseWithAi()` operates on `TextBox tb` parameter (line 467)

**Incompatibility:** Both components are designed for `RichTextBox` (rely on `TextPointer`, `FlowDocument`, `InlineUIContainer`) but the markdown editor uses `TextBox` (plain text, no FlowDocument).

## Options

1. **Create TextBox-compatible versions** — Build `TextBoxRevisionIndicator` and `TextBoxRevisionAdorner` using `TextBox.GetRectFromCharacterIndex()` for positioning and WPF adorners for visual overlay
2. **Convert MarkdownDocumentWindow to RichTextBox** — Large refactor, breaks existing plain-text editing patterns
3. **Skip revision indicators in markdown editor** — Document as out-of-scope for plain-text editing scenarios

## Recommendation

**Option 3** — Skip for now. The revision popup (`DocRevisePopup`) already provides visual feedback that AI is working. Inline indicators are cosmetic enhancements most valuable in rich-text transcript scenarios where many concurrent revisions might occur. Markdown editing is single-user, single-revision-at-a-time.

If future work requires inline indicators in markdown editor, implement Option 1 as a separate feature task with proper TextBox API design.

## Implementation

- Added `RevisionHighlight` theme colors to `Dark.xaml` (#1A3A5C) and `Light.xaml` (#D0E4F7) as prep work
- Did NOT wire components into `TriggerReviseWithAi()` due to type incompatibility
- Documented in `.squad/agents/lyra-morn/history.md`

## Next Steps

- Mark003 or team lead to decide: implement Option 1, accept Option 3, or revisit when markdown editor refactor occurs

# Decision: Convert MarkdownDocumentWindow to RichTextBox

**Date:** 2026-04-28  
**Decider:** Lyra Morn (WPF & UI Specialist)  
**Status:** Implemented  
**Commit:** e35c9b5

## Context

MarkdownDocumentWindow's source editor was implemented as a `TextBox`, which has limited support for visual overlays like adorners. To implement the "Revise with AI" feature's visual feedback (highlight adorner + inline spinner), we needed to switch to `RichTextBox` which supports the WPF adorner layer and inline UI containers.

## Decision

Convert MarkdownDocumentWindow's editor from `TextBox` to `RichTextBox`, using it **purely as a plain-text editor** with adorner support.

### Implementation approach:
1. Use `RichTextBoxExtensions` methods for all text access (`.GetPlainText()`, `.SetPlainText()`, etc.)
2. Force plain-text paste via `DataObject.AddPastingHandler` to prevent rich formatting
3. Leverage existing `RevisionHighlightAdorner` and `RevisionPendingIndicator` classes
4. Wire adorner/indicator lifecycle in `TriggerReviseWithAi()` method

### Key constraint:
**No markdown rendering/parsing changes** — the editor remains a plain-text markdown source editor. RichTextBox is used solely for its adorner layer and FlowDocument support, not for rich text editing.

## Alternatives considered

1. **Keep TextBox, overlay Canvas for highlights:** Would require manual positioning and scroll tracking. Adorner layer handles this automatically.
2. **Separate RichTextBox for revision preview:** Would duplicate content and add complexity. Current approach is simpler and more direct.

## Consequences

### Positive:
- Clean visual feedback during AI revision (highlight + spinner)
- Follows established adorner pattern (`SearchHighlightAdorner`)
- No behavior changes — still plain-text markdown editing
- All existing toolbar commands, voice input, and markdown helpers work unchanged

### Negative:
- RichTextBox has slightly different keyboard/selection behavior (mitigated by extension methods)
- Requires paste handler to prevent rich text (one-time setup cost)

## Related files

- `SquadDash/MarkdownDocumentWindow.cs` — main conversion (28 call sites)
- `SquadDash/RichTextBoxExtensions.cs` — plain-text API compatibility layer
- `SquadDash/RevisionHighlightAdorner.cs` — semi-transparent highlight adorner
- `SquadDash/RevisionPendingIndicator.cs` — inline animated spinner

## Team notes

This decision unblocks the full "Revise with AI" UX. The adorner pattern is reusable for future editor enhancements (e.g., inline diagnostics, diff previews).

# Documentation: Smooth Dictation Feature

**Date:** 2026-04-18  
**Agent:** Mira Quill  
**Status:** ✅ Complete  

## Summary

Documented the **Smooth Dictation** feature (Shift+Space) — a text cleanup utility that removes unwanted sentence breaks inserted by voice recognition.

## Decision: Where to Place the Docs

**Primary location:** `docs/features/voice-input.md` — Added new "## Smooth Dictation" section.  
**Secondary reference:** `docs/reference/keyboard-shortcuts.md` — Added Shift+Space entry to "Prompt Editor Shortcuts" table with link to feature doc.

## Rationale

1. **Feature classification:** Smooth Dictation is a text-editing utility designed to complement voice dictation workflows. While it works in any text area (prompt box, doc editor, doc source pane), it's conceptually tied to voice input — users dictate messy text, then use Smooth Dictation to clean it up.

2. **Cross-referencing:** Keyboard shortcuts table is the main discovery point for users who've learned about the shortcut elsewhere (UI button, tooltip, etc.). The table entry links to the full feature doc for context.

3. **Consistency:** Matches existing doc structure where voice-input.md documents related features (PTT, fullscreen mode, voice annotation), and keyboard-shortcuts.md serves as a reference index.

## Content

The feature doc includes:
- Problem statement (unwanted sentence breaks in voice recognition)
- Usage instructions (select + Shift+Space, or right-click menu)
- Before/after example
- Exception for pronoun "I"
- List of supported text areas

## Files Changed

- `docs/features/voice-input.md` — Added 35 lines (new section after Fullscreen Mode, before Troubleshooting)
- `docs/reference/keyboard-shortcuts.md` — Added 1 line (Shift+Space row in Prompt Editor Shortcuts table)

**Commit:** `65bbbb3`

## Impact

- ✅ New feature is discoverable in two ways: (1) keyboard shortcuts reference, (2) voice input feature doc
- ✅ Documentation style consistent with existing docs (structured, concise, examples)
- ✅ No breaking changes; pure additions

### 2026-05-07T08-03-16: Architecture decision — RichTextBox conversion path selected

**By:** Orion Vale (recommended), Mark003 (requesting assessment)

**What:** For the RevisionHighlightAdorner + RevisionPendingIndicator feature, the team should pursue Path A (convert MarkdownDocumentWindow editor TextBox to RichTextBox). 28 call sites require mechanical changes. RichTextBoxExtensions.cs already covers 100% of the gap. Paste command override required. Estimated 6-7 hours total including adorner implementation. Path B (TextBox adorner) rejected: 10.5h, O(n²) geometry, multi-revision artifacts, dead-end architecture.

**Why:** Lower effort, lower risk, better architecture, future-proof for Phase 4+ features.

## 2026-05-07 — SHA Extraction Pattern for Agent-Reported Commits

**Date:** 2026-05-07  
**Author:** Arjun Sen  
**Status:** Implemented (commit `deb8d76`)

### Context

Squad agents report git commits in their response prose (e.g., "Committed as \`abc1234\`"), not in tool output text. The original `ExtractGitCommitSha()` method only parsed git's native CLI format from tool outputs, causing agent-created commits to never appear in the Approvals panel.

### Decision

Extended `PushNotificationService.ExtractGitCommitInfo()` to accept both tool outputs and agent response text, with prioritized pattern matching:

1. **Git native format** (tool outputs): `\[\S+\s+([0-9a-f]{7,})\]`
2. **Agent-reported format** (response text): `(?:commit(?:ted)?)\s*(?:as|:)?\s*[*]*\s*\x60([0-9a-f]{7,40})\x60`
3. **Agent format fallback** (tool outputs): same pattern as #2

### Rationale

- Agents naturally report commit outcomes in conversational prose, not tool output blocks
- Backtick-wrapped SHAs are a common markdown convention in agent responses
- Pattern handles variations: `Committed as \`abc\``, `Commit: \`abc\``, `**Commit \`abc\`**`, `commit hash: abc`
- Case-insensitive matching accommodates agent phrasing variations

### Implications

- All future extraction methods should accept both structured (tool output) and unstructured (response text) sources
- Response text is the primary source for semantic extraction tasks when agents report outcomes conversationally
- Pattern: optional parameters for dual-source extraction maintain backward compatibility

### Rollout

- New `GitCommitInfo` record: `public record GitCommitInfo(string SHA, string Message)`
- Method added: `ExtractGitCommitInfo(string responseText, string toolOutput)`
- Call site updated in MainWindow.xaml.cs to pass `rawResponse` as second parameter
- Build: 0 errors
- No test changes required (existing tests cover git native format; agent format is additive)

### 2026-05-08 — Convention: Keyboard shortcuts must be discoverable and documented

**What:** Whenever a keyboard shortcut is added to any UI element in SquadDash, two things are required:
1. **Discoverable in the UI** — the shortcut must be surfaced where users can encounter it naturally. The standard mechanism is tooltip text on the associated button or control (e.g. "Abort (Ctrl+Break)"). Users who never read docs must still be able to discover the shortcut by hovering.
2. **Documented** — the shortcut must be added to the relevant docs page (typically the feature page where the control lives) AND to the docs/reference/keyboard-shortcuts.md reference table.

**Why:** Users won't discover shortcuts unless they're visible somewhere in the product. Tooltips are the natural discovery surface — they require no prior knowledge and appear on demand. Documentation ensures shortcuts are findable in help content and the keyboard reference. A shortcut that exists only in code is effectively invisible.
