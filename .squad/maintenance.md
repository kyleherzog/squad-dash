# INBOX REPORTING
# When a task produces a report (safety: report-only, or if_found: report),
# always deliver the findings to the user's Inbox panel by appending an
# INBOX_MESSAGE_JSON block at the very end of the response. Use from: "argus-weld".
# Example:
#
# INBOX_MESSAGE_JSON:
# {
#   "subject": "Maintenance Report: <Task Title>",
#   "from": "argus-weld",
#   "body": "## <Task Title>\n\n<Full findings in Markdown>",
#   "attachments": []
# }
#
# The body should contain the full structured report so the user can refer back
# to it without digging through the transcript. Keep the subject concise.

    title: Run Tests
    instructions: |
      Run all tests in the repository. Use the appropriate test runner for this
      project (e.g. `dotnet test`, `npm test`, `go test ./...`).

      {{#if if_failing == "fix"}}
      Diagnose each failing test. Fix the root cause in source — do not delete
      tests or weaken assertions. Commit all fixes to the branch.
      {{/if}}
      {{#if if_failing == "report"}}
      Do not change any code. Write a summary of every failing test, the error
      message, and your diagnosis of the likely cause. Send the report to the
      user's Inbox using an INBOX_MESSAGE_JSON block (from: "argus-weld").

    title: Eliminate Code Duplication
    instructions: |
      Scan the codebase for duplicated logic — identical or near-identical code
      blocks, copy-pasted utility functions, repeated patterns that should be
      extracted. Focus on meaningful duplication (not trivial one-liners).

      {{#if if_found == "fix"}}
      Refactor inline on the current branch. Extract shared logic, update all
      call sites, ensure tests still pass.
      {{/if}}
      {{#if if_found == "branch"}}
      Create a maintenance branch and refactor there.
      {{/if}}
      {{#if if_found == "report"}}
      Do not change any code. List each duplication instance with file paths,
      structural anchors, and a brief description of the shared logic. Send the
      report to the user's Inbox using an INBOX_MESSAGE_JSON block (from: "argus-weld").

    title: Architectural Practice Review
    instructions: |
      Review the codebase for larger architectural problems: poor separation of
      concerns, leaky abstractions, god objects, circular dependencies, missing
      service boundaries, wrong layer responsibilities, etc.

      {{#if if_found == "branch"}}
      Create a maintenance branch. Implement the improvements you identify.
      Document your reasoning in commit messages.
      {{/if}}
      {{#if if_found == "report"}}
      Do not change any code. Write a structured report of each finding:
      problem description, affected files/layers, and a recommended fix.

    title: Code Smell Cleanup
    instructions: |
      Scan the codebase for code smells: poor readability, long methods, unclear
      naming, overly complex conditionals, dead code, unnecessary abstraction,
      inefficient patterns, missing null checks, etc.

      {{#if if_found == "fix"}}
      Address smells inline on the current branch.
      {{/if}}
      {{#if if_found == "branch"}}
      Create a maintenance branch and address smells there.
      {{/if}}
      {{#if if_found == "report"}}
      Do not change any code. List each smell with file path, structural anchor,
      category, and a brief description of the issue and suggested fix. Send the
      report to the user's Inbox using an INBOX_MESSAGE_JSON block (from: "argus-weld").

  - id: speed-improvements
    enabled: true
    frequency: daily
    safety: branch
    title: Performance Improvements
    instructions: |
      Review the codebase for performance opportunities: inefficient algorithms,
      unnecessary allocations, repeated expensive operations, missing caching,
      synchronous I/O where async would improve throughput, LINQ queries that
      could be rewritten, N+1 query patterns, etc.

      {{#if if_found == "fix"}}
      Implement optimisations inline on the current branch. Add a brief comment
      explaining the change where the improvement is non-obvious.
      {{/if}}
      {{#if if_found == "branch"}}
      Create a maintenance branch and implement improvements there.
      {{/if}}

    title: TODO / FIXME / HACK Scanner
    instructions: |
      Scan all source files for TODO, FIXME, HACK, XXX, and NOTE comments.
      For each comment found, create a task entry in `.squad/tasks.md` if one
      does not already exist for that comment. Include the file path, line number,
      and the full comment text in the task description.

      Do not modify any source files. Only append to `.squad/tasks.md`.

      (`[x]`) and have no open sub-tasks. Archive removed items to
      `.squad/tasks-archive.md` (append, do not overwrite) with a timestamp.

      Do not modify any source files.

  - id: commit-review
    enabled: false
    frequency: per-commit

    title: Commit Quality Review
    instructions: |
      Retrieve the list of commits since the last time this task ran (use the
      stored last-run SHA if available; otherwise review the last 10 commits).
      For each commit, review the diff and note:
      - Code quality issues introduced (smells, complexity, missing tests)
      - Missing or inadequate commit message detail
      - Potential bugs or regressions
      - Positive patterns worth reinforcing

      Write a structured review report. Do not change any code. Send the report
      to the user's Inbox using an INBOX_MESSAGE_JSON block (from: "argus-weld").

  - id: xml-doc-coverage

    title: XML Doc Comment Coverage
    instructions: |
      Scan all public types, methods, properties, and interfaces in the C# source
      for missing XML doc comments (`<summary>`, `<param>`, `<returns>`).
      Produce a coverage report grouped by file, listing each undocumented member.
      Do not change any code. Send the report to the user's Inbox using an
      INBOX_MESSAGE_JSON block (from: "argus-weld").

      If this is not a C# project, adapt to the equivalent docstring convention
      (JSDoc for TypeScript/JavaScript, docstrings for Python, godoc for Go).

  - id: magic-numbers
    enabled: false
    frequency: daily
    safety: branch
    title: Extract Magic Numbers and Hardcoded Strings
    instructions: |
      Scan the codebase for magic numbers (numeric literals used in logic without
      explanation) and hardcoded strings that belong in named constants or
      configuration (connection strings, URLs, thresholds, timeouts, limits, etc.).

      {{#if if_found == "extract"}}
      Extract each magic value into a named constant or config entry. Update all
      references. Commit to a maintenance branch.
      {{/if}}
      {{#if if_found == "report"}}
      Do not change any code. List each instance with file path, structural anchor
      (e.g. ClassName.MethodName), the literal value, and a suggested constant name.

    safety: report-only
    title: README Currency Check
    instructions: |
      Compare README.md (and any other top-level docs) against the current state
      of the codebase. Check for:
      - Setup or build instructions that no longer match the actual commands
      - Outdated dependency versions or requirements
      - References to files, directories, or features that no longer exist
      - Missing documentation for significant new features or changed APIs

      Write a gap report. Do not change any files. Send the report to the user's
      Inbox using an INBOX_MESSAGE_JSON block (from: "argus-weld").

  - id: unused-dependencies
    enabled: false
    frequency: daily
    safety: report-only
    title: Unused Dependency Scan
    instructions: |
      Check for NuGet packages (*.csproj), npm packages (package.json), or other
      dependency manifests in the repository. Identify packages that appear to be
      unused (not referenced in source or only referenced transitively).

      Write a report listing each potentially unused dependency, the manifest file
      it appears in, and a note on how to verify and remove it. Do not change any
      files. Send the report to the user's Inbox using an INBOX_MESSAGE_JSON block
      (from: "argus-weld").

  - id: docs-review
    enabled: false
    frequency: daily
    safety: report-only
    title: Documentation Review
    instructions: |
      Review the documentation in the `docs/` folder (or the repo's primary docs
      location) for the following issues:

      1. **Accuracy** — Are instructions, command examples, configuration values,
         and feature descriptions still accurate relative to the current codebase?
         Flag anything that appears outdated or incorrect.

      2. **Broken internal links** — Scan all Markdown files for links to other
         pages within the docs. Check whether each target file exists. If a page
         exists but has `published: false` (or equivalent front-matter), flag any
         other page that links to it as a warning — the reader will hit an
         unpublished page.

      3. **Broken external links** — Optionally check HTTP/HTTPS links to see if
         they return a non-200 status. Flag dead external links.

      4. **Missing images** — Find image references (`![...](...)`). Check whether
         the referenced file exists on disk. Flag missing image files.

      5. **Orphaned pages** — Identify docs pages that are not reachable from any
         other page (no inbound links from within the docs tree). These may be
         forgotten or accidentally unpublished pages.

      {{#if if_found == "report"}}
      Do not change any files. Produce a structured report grouped by issue type,
      listing file path, structural anchor (e.g. `## Section > ### Subsection`),
      and a description of each problem found. Include a severity: Warning for
      unpublished-page links and dead links, Info for orphaned pages and accuracy
      concerns. Send the report to the user's Inbox using an INBOX_MESSAGE_JSON
      block (from: "argus-weld").
      {{/if}}
      {{#if if_found == "fix"}}
      Correct accuracy issues and fix broken links where possible (e.g. update a
      link target, remove a dead link). Commit changes to a maintenance branch.
      Items that require human judgment (accuracy rewrites, missing images) should
      still be reported.

    title: Naming Convention Audit
    instructions: |
      Audit the codebase for naming inconsistencies:
      - Variables, fields, properties, methods deviating from the project's
        established convention (PascalCase, camelCase, snake_case, etc.)
      - Inconsistent pluralisation (e.g. `items` vs `itemList` vs `itemCollection`)
      - Abbreviations used in some places but not others
      - Test method naming inconsistencies

      {{#if if_found == "fix"}}
      Rename inconsistencies directly on the current branch. Update all
      references. Ensure the project still builds.
      {{/if}}
      {{#if if_found == "report"}}
      Do not change any code. List each inconsistency with file path, structural
      anchor (e.g. ClassName.MethodName), current name, and suggested name.
