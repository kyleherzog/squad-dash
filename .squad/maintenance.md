# INBOX REPORTING
# When a task produces a report (safety: report-only, or if_found: report),
# always deliver the findings to the user's Inbox panel by appending an
# INBOX_MESSAGE_JSON block at the very end of the response. Use from: "argus-weld".
# Example:
#
# INBOX_MESSAGE_JSON:
# {
#   "subject": "Maintenance Report: <Task Title>",
#   "from": "argus-weld",
#   "body": "## <Task Title>\n\n<Full findings in Markdown>",
#   "attachments": []
# }
#
# The body should contain the full structured report so the user can refer back
# to it without digging through the transcript. Keep the subject concise.

# DECOMPOSE POLICY
#
# For branch-capable tasks, the AI chooses one of two execution paths:
#
# PATH 1 — Implement directly (single pass) — use when ALL of:
#   • ≤ 5 files affected
#   • No ordering dependencies between changes
#   • Limited blast radius (no cross-cutting / public API changes)
#   • A single pass can leave the build green
#
# PATH 2 — Decompose (emit TASKS_JSON) — use when ANY of:
#   • > 5 files affected
#   • Changes have ordering dependencies
#   • High blast radius (cross-cutting changes, public API modifications)
#   • Mid-pass breakage risk (build would be red between steps)
#
# When decomposing:
#   • Do NOT make any code changes in the analysis pass
#   • Design 2–25 discrete steps, each leaving the build green when done
#   • Write fully self-contained step descriptions (no shared context assumed)
#   • Use dependsOn to enforce ordering between steps
#   • Set branch to {{branch}} (same branch for all steps)
#   • Emit TASKS_JSON as the last content in your response

    title: Documentation Review
    instructions: |
      Review the documentation in the `docs/` folder (or the repo's primary docs
      location) for the following issues:

      1. **Accuracy** — Are instructions, command examples, configuration values,
         and feature descriptions still accurate relative to the current codebase?
         Flag anything that appears outdated or incorrect.

      2. **Broken internal links** — Scan all Markdown files for links to other
         pages within the docs. Check whether each target file exists. If a page
         exists but has `published: false` (or equivalent front-matter), flag any
         other page that links to it as a warning — the reader will hit an
         unpublished page.

      3. **Broken external links** — Optionally check HTTP/HTTPS links to see if
         they return a non-200 status. Flag dead external links.

      4. **Missing images** — Find image references (`![...](...)`). Check whether
         the referenced file exists on disk. Flag missing image files.

      5. **Orphaned pages** — Identify docs pages that are not reachable from any
         other page (no inbound links from within the docs tree). These may be
         forgotten or accidentally unpublished pages.

      {{#if if_found == "report"}}
      Do not change any files. Produce a structured report grouped by issue type,
      listing file path, structural anchor (e.g. `## Section > ### Subsection`),
      and a description of each problem found. Include a severity: Warning for
      unpublished-page links and dead links, Info for orphaned pages and accuracy
      concerns. Send the report to the user's Inbox using an INBOX_MESSAGE_JSON
      block (from: "argus-weld").
      {{/if}}
      {{#if if_found == "fix"}}
      Correct accuracy issues and fix broken links where possible (e.g. update a
      link target, remove a dead link). Commit changes to a maintenance branch.
      Items that require human judgment (accuracy rewrites, missing images) should
      still be reported.

    instructions: |
      Scan the codebase for duplicated logic — identical or near-identical code
      blocks, copy-pasted utility functions, repeated patterns that should be
      extracted. Focus on meaningful duplication (not trivial one-liners).

      {{#if if_found == "fix"}}
      Refactor inline on the current branch. Extract shared logic, update all
      call sites, ensure tests still pass.
      {{/if}}

    frequency: weekly-Thursday
    safety: report-only
    title: Error Handling Audit
    instructions: |
      Audit the codebase for error-handling gaps and unsafe exception patterns.
      This task is designed to work with any language, framework, or platform —
      desktop, web, mobile, CLI, or server. Begin by identifying the tech stack
      (language, UI framework if any, async model, logging infrastructure) so you
      can apply the relevant sub-checks below accurately.

      For each finding, record: file path, structural anchor (function/class/method),
      category (from the list), severity (Critical / High / Medium / Low), and a
      concrete description of the problem and the recommended fix.

      **Categories to check:**

      1. **Silent error suppression** — catch or error-handler blocks that swallow
         failures with no logging, no rethrow, and no user notification. Examples
         across stacks:
         - C#: `catch { }` or `catch (Exception ex) { }` with empty body
         - JavaScript/TypeScript: `.catch(() => {})` or empty `catch (e) {}`
         - Python: bare `except: pass` or `except Exception: pass`
         - Go: `if err != nil { _ = err }` (error discarded)
         - Swift/Kotlin: `try? ...` or `try { } catch { }` with no handling
         Distinguish genuine best-effort suppression (e.g. cleanup during shutdown)
         from silently dropped failures that callers or users need to know about.

      2. **Catch-and-return-sentinel** — functions that catch internally and return
         a sentinel value (null, false, undefined, -1, empty string) with no log and
         no way for the caller to distinguish "legitimately absent" from "threw
         unexpectedly". Callers proceed as if nothing went wrong.

      3. **UI event/callback handlers without error guards** — handlers that run
         in response to user interaction or framework lifecycle events and are not
         wrapped in error handling. An unguarded exception here typically crashes
         or freezes the UI without a meaningful message. Applies to:
         - Desktop (WPF/WinForms/MAUI): event handlers, DispatcherTimer callbacks
         - Web front-end (React/Vue/Angular/Svelte): onClick, useEffect, lifecycle
           hooks, component error boundaries missing where subtrees can fail
         - Mobile (Android/iOS/Flutter): Activity/Fragment callbacks, lifecycle
           methods, gesture handlers, widget build methods
         - Node.js/Express: route handlers and middleware without next(err) calls
         Each handler should catch, log, and recover or degrade gracefully.

      4. **Unguarded async / concurrent entry points** — language-specific patterns
         where exceptions escape the normal error-propagation chain:
         - C#: `async void` (non-event-handler); fire-and-forget `_ = Task.Run(...)`
           or unawaited calls; lost exceptions only surface via
           `TaskScheduler.UnobservedTaskException`
         - JavaScript/TypeScript: unhandled Promise rejections (`.then()` without
           `.catch()`, `async` functions called without `await` or `.catch()`);
           missing `process.on('unhandledRejection')` / `window.onunhandledrejection`
         - Python: background threads or `asyncio` tasks whose exceptions are never
           retrieved; `asyncio.create_task()` results that are dropped
         - Go: goroutines without a deferred `recover()`; errors from goroutines
           that are never sent back over a channel
         - Swift: `Task { }` blocks where thrown errors are silently discarded
         - Kotlin: `launch { }` coroutines without a `CoroutineExceptionHandler`
         Flag each case and evaluate whether the exception needs to surface.

      5. **Missing resource cleanup on error paths** — code that acquires a resource
         (file handle, network connection, lock, database transaction, event
         subscription, native handle) without guaranteeing release on all exit paths:
         - C#: missing `using` / `IDisposable` or `finally`
         - JavaScript: missing `finally` or manual cleanup after `try`
         - Python: missing `with` / context manager or `finally`
         - Go: missing `defer` for `Close()` / `Unlock()` / `rows.Close()`
         - Java/Kotlin: missing try-with-resources or `finally`
         - Swift: missing `defer` for cleanup
         An exception partway through leaves resources leaked or state corrupted.

      6. **Overly broad exception catches** — catching the most general error type
         when a narrower type would be more appropriate. Broad catches can mask
         programming errors (null dereferences, type errors, logic bugs) that should
         propagate and be fixed. Examples:
         - C#: `catch (Exception)` instead of `catch (IOException)`
         - JavaScript: `catch (e)` on code that should only handle `NetworkError`
         - Python: `except Exception` instead of `except ValueError`
         - Go: not applicable (explicit error types), but note any pattern of
           comparing `err != nil` without inspecting the error type where type
           matters

      7. **Exception / error messages missing context** — throw or log sites where
         the message does not include enough information to diagnose the failure:
         operation name, input value, file path, object identity, or state at the
         time of failure. A bare "parsing failed" or "unexpected error" is not
         actionable. The message should answer: what was being done, on what input,
         and what went wrong specifically.

      8. **Background / worker errors not surfaced to the user** — exceptions on
         background threads, worker processes, service workers, web workers, or async
         tasks that are logged (or not) but never result in any user-visible feedback.
         Silent background failures leave the application in an inconsistent state
         with no indication to the user. Check for appropriate error-reporting
         callbacks, status indicators, or toast/notification dispatch after failure.

      9. **Global error handler gaps** — applications that do not register (or
         register incompletely) a last-resort unhandled-error handler:
         - C#: `AppDomain.UnhandledException`, `TaskScheduler.UnobservedTaskException`,
           `Dispatcher.UnhandledException` (WPF) / `Application.ThreadException` (WinForms)
         - JavaScript browser: `window.onerror`, `window.onunhandledrejection`
         - Node.js: `process.on('uncaughtException')`, `process.on('unhandledRejection')`
         - Python: `sys.excepthook`, logging of unhandled asyncio exceptions
         - Android: `Thread.setDefaultUncaughtExceptionHandler`
         - iOS: `NSSetUncaughtExceptionHandler`, signal handlers for SIGABRT/SIGSEGV
         - Flutter: `FlutterError.onError`, `PlatformDispatcher.instance.onError`
         Missing handlers mean crashes produce no diagnostic information.

      10. **Cancellation / interruption signals swallowed** — language-specific
          cancellation mechanisms that are silently consumed rather than propagated:
          - C#: `OperationCanceledException` / `TaskCanceledException` caught without
            rethrow; `CancellationToken` passed to a method but never checked
          - JavaScript: `AbortController` / `AbortSignal` ignored in fetch/async code
          - Python: `asyncio.CancelledError` caught and not re-raised (required in
            Python ≥ 3.8); `KeyboardInterrupt` swallowed in a bare `except`
          - Go: `ctx.Done()` channel never selected on in long-running goroutines
          Swallowing cancellation breaks cooperative shutdown and resource cleanup.

      {{#if if_found == "report"}}
      Do not change any code. Produce a structured report grouped by category,
      then by severity within each category. For each finding include:

      Compare README.md (and any other top-level docs) against the current state
      of the codebase. Check for:
      - Setup or build instructions that no longer match the actual commands
      - Outdated dependency versions or requirements
      - References to files, directories, or features that no longer exist
      - Missing documentation for significant new features or changed APIs

      Write a gap report. Do not change any files. Send the report to the user's
      Inbox using an INBOX_MESSAGE_JSON block (from: "argus-weld").

    title: Run Tests
    instructions: |
      Run all tests in the repository. Use the appropriate test runner for this
      project (e.g. `dotnet test`, `npm test`, `go test ./...`).
      
      {{#if if_failing == "fix"}}
      Diagnose each failing test. Fix the root cause in source — do not delete
      tests or weaken assertions. Commit all fixes to the branch.
      {{/if}}
      {{#if if_failing == "report"}}
      Do not change any code. Write a summary of every failing test, the error
      message, and your diagnosis of the likely cause. Send the report to the
      user's Inbox using an INBOX_MESSAGE_JSON block (from: "argus-weld").

    title: Security Vulnerability Audit
    instructions: |
      Audit the codebase for security vulnerabilities and unsafe patterns.
      Focus on:
      - Injection risks (SQL, command, path traversal, format string)
      - Secrets or credentials hard-coded or logged in plain text
      - Unsafe deserialization or untrusted data passed to eval-equivalent APIs
      - Missing input validation or output encoding (XSS, open redirect)
      - Overly broad exception catches that swallow security-relevant errors
      - Insecure cryptography (MD5/SHA1 for integrity, ECB mode, short keys, hard-coded IVs)
      - Dependency or NuGet package references with known CVEs (check via `dotnet list package --vulnerable` if available)
      - File or network operations that trust caller-supplied paths without sanitisation
      - Sensitive data written to logs, temp files, or crash dumps
      {{#if if_found == "report"}}
      Do not change any code. Produce a structured report grouped by severity
      (Critical / High / Medium / Low), listing file path, structural anchor
      (e.g. ClassName.MethodName), and a description of each finding.
      Send the report to the user's Inbox using an INBOX_MESSAGE_JSON block
      (from: "argus-weld").
      {{/if}}
      {{#if if_found == "fix"}}
      Fix issues that are safe to patch automatically (remove hard-coded secrets,
      add input guards, replace deprecated crypto calls). Commit to a maintenance
      branch. Issues requiring design decisions or external dependency updates
      should still be reported in an INBOX_MESSAGE_JSON block (from: "argus-weld").

    title: TODO / FIXME / HACK Scanner
    instructions: |
      Scan all source files for TODO, FIXME, HACK, XXX, and NOTE comments.
      For each comment found, create a task entry in `.squad/tasks.md` if one
      does not already exist for that comment. Include the file path, line number,
      and the full comment text in the task description.

      Do not modify any source files. Only append to `.squad/tasks.md`.

    title: Unused Dependency Scan
    instructions: |
      Check for NuGet packages (*.csproj), npm packages (package.json), or other
      dependency manifests in the repository. Identify packages that appear to be
      unused (not referenced in source or only referenced transitively).

      Write a report listing each potentially unused dependency, the manifest file
      it appears in, and a note on how to verify and remove it. Do not change any
      files. Send the report to the user's Inbox using an INBOX_MESSAGE_JSON block
      (from: "argus-weld").

    title: XML Doc Comment Coverage
    instructions: |
      Scan all public types, methods, properties, and interfaces in the C# source
      for missing XML doc comments (`<summary>`, `<param>`, `<returns>`).
      Produce a coverage report grouped by file, listing each undocumented member.
      Do not change any code. Send the report to the user's Inbox using an
      INBOX_MESSAGE_JSON block (from: "argus-weld").

      If this is not a C# project, adapt to the equivalent docstring convention
      (JSDoc for TypeScript/JavaScript, docstrings for Python, godoc for Go).

      Query the GitHub API to find new issues posted to the repository in the last
      24 hours. {{#if includePullRequests}}Also include pull requests.{{/if}}{{#if !includePullRequests}}Pull requests are not included in this report.{{/if}}

      Use the GitHub CLI (`gh`) to query the repository. The query should:
      - Identify the current repository (use `gh repo view --json nameWithOwner`)
      - Search for issues created in the last 24 hours using GitHub's search syntax
      {{#if includePullRequests}}- Also search for pull requests created in the last 24 hours{{/if}}
      - Retrieve title, number, creation time, and URL for each result

      Format the findings into a clear, actionable report:
      1. **Summary**: Total count of new issues{{#if includePullRequests}} and pull requests{{/if}}
      2. **New Issues** (if any):
         - List each with: #<number> Title (created: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM UTC)
         - Include link: https://github.com/owner/repo/issues/<number>
      {{#if includePullRequests}}
      3. **New Pull Requests** (if any):
         - List each with: #<number> Title (created: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM UTC)
         - Include link: https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/<number>
      4. **Suggested Next Steps**: Brief recommendations for triage/review

      Do not change any code or issues. Send the report to the user's Inbox using
      an INBOX_MESSAGE_JSON block (from: "argus-weld").

      **Note**: This task is designed to be distributed to other repositories. It
      queries the current workspace's repository dynamically, so it will work on
      any GitHub repository that uses SquadDash.
