## 🟡 Mid Priority

- [x] **Doc editor — Phase 1: swap DocSourceTextBox to RichTextBox + plain-text adapter** *(Owner: Arjun Sen)*
- [x] **Doc editor — Phase 2: migrate all DocSourceTextBox API call sites to RichTextBox** *(Owner: Arjun Sen)*

- [x] **Doc editor — Phase 3: animated inline indicator for pending Revise with AI** *(Owner: Arjun Sen)*
  Create a `RevisionPendingIndicator` class: an `InlineUIContainer` wrapping an animated WPF element
  (pulsing border or spinner). On Revise with AI submit (`onSubmitting` callback): insert the indicator
  `Inline` at the selection's `TextPointer`. On `ApplyDocRevision` (success or fallback): remove it.
  Indicator must never appear in `.GetPlainText()` output (it is an object node, not a character).
  The user's normal selection should be unaffected — the indicator is a separate inline sibling.
  **Blocked by:** Phase 2.

- [x] **[Vesper audit] Test coverage — BuiltInPromptInjections, PromptContextDiagnostics** *(Owner: Vesper Knox)*
  Both classes have zero test coverage. `BuiltInPromptInjections` depends on the triggered injection
  evaluator — write tests using a fake/stub evaluator. `PromptContextDiagnostics` is pure formatting
  logic and should be straightforward to cover directly.

- [x] **[Vesper audit] Test coverage — WorkspaceOpenCoordinator, PromptInteractionLogic multi-path workflows** *(Owner: Vesper Knox)*
  Both classes have partial coverage but the branching paths (error paths, edge cases, multi-step
  coordination flows) are not exercised. Audit the existing tests, identify missing paths, and fill
  them in. Focus on correctness contracts rather than line-count.

- [x] **Loop Settings popup — render loop file frontmatter as UI controls** *(Owner: Lyra Morn)*
  When the user right-clicks the gear/settings icon in the Loop panel, parse the YAML frontmatter
  of the active loop `.md` file and render its keys as controls in a popup:
  - Known UI keys get typed controls: `commit_after_task` → 3-way radio/dropdown (`always`/`never`/`ask`);
    bool keys (`build_verify`, `test_after_task`) → toggle/checkbox.
  - Unknown string keys get a text field (injection variables such as `build_command`, `commit_trailer`).
  - On save, write updated values back to the frontmatter block of the loop file.
  - Keys prefixed with `#` (comments) or without a recognized type hint should be ignored or shown as read-only labels.
  Scope: parsing, popup XAML, save-back logic. The `{{variable}}` substitution at prompt send time is a separate task.
  ✅ Implemented — `OpenLoopConfigFlyout` / `LoopConfigFlyoutMode`; frontmatter parsed via `LoopMdParser.Parse` and rendered as typed controls; save-back wired.

- [x] **Loop "Do these" — inject TasksFilterBox text into live loop prompt** *(Owner: Lyra Morn)*
  When the "▶ Do these" button starts the loop, the active Tasks panel filter text is currently only
  substituted in the preview window (`RefreshLoopMergedView`), not in the actual prompt sent to the AI.
  The `[**FILTER**]` placeholder (and its smart context-aware expansion) must also be applied at loop
  start time — either by writing a temporary substituted copy of the loop file, or by injecting the
  filter as a `{{variable}}` that the loop controller resolves before sending the prompt.
  ✅ Fixed (commit d4c5c1b) — `BuildFilterInstruction` shared by preview+live; `LoopController.StartAsync` takes `filterText`; both paths unified via `BuildMergedBody`; system vars `{{routing_instruction}}` etc. removed from shipped loop files.

- [x] **Loop Settings — `{{variable}}` injection at prompt send time** *(Owner: Arjun Sen)*
  Before sending the loop prompt, substitute `{{key}}` tokens in the prompt body with the
  corresponding frontmatter values from the active loop file. Known UI keys (`commit_after_task`,
  `build_verify`, `test_after_task`) and user-defined injection variables (`build_command`,
  `commit_trailer`, etc.) should all be substituted. Missing keys are left as-is.
  Group-type options (UI headers) are skipped. Implemented in `LoopController.ExpandVariables`
  and `LoopMdParser.BuildMergedBody`.

- [x] **Loop template preprocessing — `{{#if}}`/`{{#unless}}` conditional blocks** *(Owner: Arjun Sen)*
  Extend the loop prompt preprocessing pipeline (from the `{{variable}}` injection task) to support
  conditional blocks. Loop file authors write conditions in the body; SquadDash evaluates them against
  the active frontmatter option values before sending the prompt. The AI receives only clean resolved
  text — no template syntax. Implemented in `LoopMdParser.PreprocessConditionals`, called before
  plain `{{key}}` substitution in both `LoopController.ExpandVariables` and `LoopMdParser.BuildMergedBody`.



- [x] **Transcript — ghost selection highlight when content streams in** *(Owner: Arjun Sen)*

- [ ] **[Orion audit] `_isPromptRunning` — move ownership to PromptExecutionController** *(Owner: Arjun Sen)*
  `_isPromptRunning` is declared in MainWindow, mutated by PEC via setter delegate, read by
  `BackgroundTaskPresenter` via getter delegate, and read directly by MainWindow at 8 call sites.
  PEC is the natural owner (it sets the flag at prompt start/end). Consolidate ownership in PEC
  and expose it via a clean property rather than scattered delegates.

- [ ] **[Vesper audit] DocStatusStore — review silent catch blocks** *(Owner: Arjun Sen)*
  Vesper's audit flagged 34 bare catch blocks across the codebase; `DocStatusStore` in particular
  has silent failure suppression that may hide real errors. Review and replace with at minimum a
  `SquadDashTrace.Write` call so failures surface in the trace log.

- [x] **Revise with AI — dynamic offset tracking for async revision** *(Owner: Arjun Sen)*
  When Revise with AI (Ctrl+Shift+A) is invoked, `selStart` is saved as an integer. If the user
  edits text *before* that offset while the AI is working, the saved integer is stale. Implement
  a text-change listener on `DocSourceTextBox` that adjusts the saved start offset based on
  `TextChangedEventArgs` delta (characters inserted/deleted and at what position). Represent the
  in-flight revision as a tracked `PendingRevision` record with a mutable `AdjustedStart` property.
  On each `TextChanged` event, for every pending revision: if the edit is before `AdjustedStart`,
  shift it by `(inserted - deleted)` chars. When the AI response lands, use `AdjustedStart` and
  the original length to check if the original text is still intact before applying the replacement.
  Multiple in-flight revisions should each track their own offset independently.

---

## 🔴 High Priority

- [x] **[Orion audit] Bridge stall — surface "No bridge activity" warning in UI** *(Owner: Orion Vale)*
  PromptHealth already logs `No bridge activity for Xs since prompt start` to the trace file, but this
  is completely invisible to the user. When the warning fires (currently at 96s), show a visible indicator
  in the UI — e.g. a status bar message, a subtle pulsing warning on the spinner, or a tooltip on the
  activity indicator — so the user knows the bridge is stalled rather than just seeing a silent spinner.
  Root cause traced to a test-flood bridge cascade (2026-05-13): bridge was overwhelmed by unit test
  requests flooding the shared process, entered inactivity-timeout loop, left main coordinator prompt
  stuck for 204 seconds with no UI feedback. The `No bridge activity for 96s` log entry existed but
  user had to manually abort after 3+ minutes. Consider also adding an auto-recovery suggestion after
  the threshold (e.g. "Retry" button).

- [ ] **WinGet — smoke-test installer on clean VM** *(Owner: you — manual step)*
  Run `.\installer\build-installer.ps1 -Version 1.0.0` (requires Inno Setup 6 installed locally),
  then install on a clean Windows VM with only Node.js pre-installed. Verify: launcher starts,
  SDK bridge connects, workspaces resolve correctly from `%LocalAppData%\SquadDash\app\`.
  **Blocks:** GitHub Release, WinGet submission.

- [x] **[Orion audit] AgentThreadRegistry — lock down mutable backing collections** *(Owner: Arjun Sen)*
  Already implemented: all four collections (`ThreadsByKey`, `ThreadsByToolCallId`, `LaunchesByToolCallId`,
  `ThreadOrder`) expose `IReadOnlyDictionary`/`IReadOnlyList` interfaces. Backing fields are
  `private readonly` — external callers cannot mutate them.

- [x] **[Vesper audit] Test coverage — CommitApprovalStore, DocStatusStore, DocTopicsLoader, LoopOutputStore** *(Owner: Vesper Knox)*
  All four classes have zero test coverage despite critical responsibilities:
  `CommitApprovalStore` (JSON persistence, 200-item cap), `DocStatusStore` (approval tracking,
  case-insensitive key lookup), `DocTopicsLoader` (SUMMARY.md parsing, folder scanning),
  `LoopOutputStore` (sequential log numbering). Write unit tests for each.

## 🟡 Mid Priority

- [x] Screenshots health panel — XAML + bindings + status UX *(Owner: lyra-morn)*

- [ ] **WinGet — create GitHub Release v1.0.0** *(Owner: you — manual step)*
  After smoke-test passes: create GitHub Release `v1.0.0`, attach the installer `.exe` and its
  SHA256 hash. The public download URL is required for `wingetcreate`.
  **Blocked by:** smoke-test passing.

- [ ] **WinGet — generate and submit manifest** *(Owner: Jae Min — automated once release exists)*
  Run `wingetcreate new <installer-url>`, add `OpenJS.NodeJS` as a `PackageDependencies` entry
  in the installer manifest YAML, open PR to `microsoft/winget-pkgs`.
  **Blocked by:** GitHub Release v1.0.0 existing with a stable download URL.

- [x] **WinGet — document Node.js prerequisite** *(Owner: Jae Min)*
  `runPrompt.js` calls `node` from PATH — Node.js is required but not bundled.
  Update `README.md` to document this prerequisite clearly. The WinGet manifest will list
  `OpenJS.NodeJS` as a dependency but a README callout helps users who install manually.

- [ ] **WinGet — Phase 2: release automation** *(Owner: Jae Min)*
  Create `.github/workflows/release.yml`: on `v*` tag push, run `dotnet publish`, bundle
  installer, upload to GitHub Release, run `wingetcreate update`, open PR to winget-pkgs
  automatically. Requires `WINGET_PKGS_PAT` repo secret.
  **Blocked by:** Phase 1 (manual release) succeeding at least once.

- [ ] **WinGet — write RELEASING.md runbook** *(Owner: Jae Min)*
  Document the full release checklist: bump version, tag, let automation run, verify winget PR.
  Include manual fallback steps. Useful for the first few releases before automation is trusted.

- [x] **Physics-based activity spinner on agent cards** *(Owner: Lyra Morn)*
  Add a small spinning circle (fits in ~18×18px) to the left of each agent card's status text
  (e.g. "Running", "Waiting", "Stalled"). The spinner uses physics (momentum + friction) driven
  by a `DispatcherTimer` with a `RotateTransform` + `SolidColorBrush` animated via HSV math.

  **Size & placement:**
  - Max diameter: 18px (writing/red state). Min diameter: ~12px (~2/3, thinking/blue state).
  - Placed immediately left of the status text label, occupying ~1 character width.
  - Fits in an 18×18 bounding square.

  **Physics:**
  - Speed driven by agent activity (tool calls, token stream). Each event adds momentum.
  - Friction decay: 20–30 seconds coast-to-stop during silence (not 10s).
  - Fade out only AFTER the spinner has slowed to a complete stop (~2s fade).

  **Color — thinking vs writing:**
  - Blue = thinking/reading (default). Red = actively writing/streaming output.
  - Transition to red when write activity detected; fade back to blue after 5–10s of no writes.
  - Color transitions are smooth (animated, not instant).

  **Saturation/lightness pulse at max speed** (speed perception ceiling):
  - At max spin speed, hue stays fixed; instead oscillate saturation+lightness for visibility.
  - Dark theme: oscillate toward brighter (higher contrast). Light theme: oscillate toward darker.
  - Creates a pulsing "maxed out" look as a second dimension of activity signal.
  - If theme changes while the spinner is running, update the oscillation direction accordingly.

  **Accessibility (colorblind):**
  - Shape/size difference: red state = larger diameter (18px), blue state = smaller (12px).
  - This gives a non-color cue for writing vs thinking.

  **When to show:** only while an agent turn is active (`isCurrentRunThread` true).
  Hide (or fade out after stop) when idle/waiting with no active turn.

## 🟡 Mid Priority — Annotation Editor (Paste Image Window)

- [ ] **[Annot #1] Shift-click multi-drop mode indicator** *(Owner: Lyra Morn)*
  When arrow or rectangle button is shift-clicked to enter multi-drop mode, show a rounded-rect
  underline beneath the active button (same style as document chips / orientation buttons).
  Update tooltip/hover hint to say "Shift+click to drop multiples in a row". Update docs.

- [ ] **[Annot #2] Bug: double undo for each rectangle in shift-click mode** *(Owner: Lyra Morn)*
  Each rectangle dropped in shift-click multi-drop mode adds 2 undo entries instead of 1.
  Dropping 3 rectangles requires 6 Ctrl+Z presses. Not observed for arrows. Find duplicate push
  to the undo stack in the rectangle placement path and remove it.

- [ ] **[Annot #3] Arrow drag: origin point too close to arrowhead** *(Owner: Lyra Morn)*
  When click-dragging to place an arrow, the drag origin starts too close to the tip.
  At minimum double the initial drag distance so the arrow has meaningful length on first drag.

- [ ] **[Annot #4] Enter key crops to crop rectangle + undo + window resize** *(Owner: Lyra Morn)*
  When the crop rectangle is visible and the user presses Enter:
  - Crop the image to the rectangle bounds
  - Resize the annotation window to fit the new (smaller) image
  - Push a full undo entry so Ctrl+Z restores the full image + window size
  - After cropping, user should be able to zoom (Ctrl+wheel) and annotate the smaller region

- [ ] **[Annot #5] Text annotation tool (T button)** *(Owner: Lyra Morn)*
  New toolbar button "T". On click, user draws a rectangle on the canvas. That rectangle becomes
  a text annotation box with: flashing I-beam caret, character entry + paste + backspace/delete,
  word-wrap within box, auto-shrink font to fit (min 12pt Calibri), drag handles to resize/reposition,
  Shift+Enter for newline, Enter to deselect. Font: Calibri ≥12pt (OCR-legible).

- [ ] **[Annot #6] Bug: mouse cursor drop tool — nothing happens on click** *(Owner: Lyra Morn)*
  After using arrow tool, clicking the "drop cursor" tool does nothing. Likely a tool-state
  machine bug — tool mode may not be resetting correctly when switching from arrow to cursor tool.
  Investigate state transitions between annotation tool modes.

- [ ] **[Annot #7] Cropping tool cursor (Photoshop-style)** *(Owner: Lyra Morn)*
  When the crop tool / default crop state is active, show a Photoshop-style crop cursor
  (overlapping rectangles / corner brackets). Add to AnnotationCursors class.

- [ ] **[Annot #8] Drop mouse-cursor tool cursor: arrow + plus** *(Owner: Lyra Morn)*
  When the "drop mouse cursor" tool is active, the canvas cursor should show a mouse-arrow icon
  with a small plus/crosshair next to it (same pattern as arrow/rectangle tool cursors).
  The center of the crosshair is the hotspot. Add to AnnotationCursors class.

- [ ] **[Annot #9] Attach Image + Cancel buttons — move to far right** *(Owner: Lyra Morn)*
  Reposition the Attach Image and Cancel buttons to be right-aligned in the toolbar/footer bar.

## 🟡 Mid Priority — MainWindow.xaml.cs Refactoring

> Tracked from Orion + Lyra review (2026-05-19). Full details in session files.
> Full report: `mainwindow-refactor-review.md` (Orion) + `mainwindow-xaml-review.md` (Lyra).
> Current file: ~28,687 lines. Goal: extract cohesive domains into separate classes.

- [ ] **[Refactor Phase 1a] Extract `TranscriptSearchController`** *(Owner: Lyra Morn)*
  ~930 lines of transcript search logic (find-in-transcript, Shift+F3 cycling, highlight adorner
  management). `SearchWalker` is already embedded. Minimal `this` dependencies — easy to inject
  via constructor. Fixes the Shift+F3 duplication that currently exists in 2 separate search paths.
  Full line ranges in `mainwindow-refactor-review.md`.

- [ ] **[Refactor Phase 1b] Extract `PromptKeyboardController`** *(Owner: Lyra Morn)*
  ~700 lines of KeyDown/KeyUp handlers for the prompt input area. Pure input routing with no deep
  WPF visual-tree dependencies. Easy to inject Dispatcher + action callbacks.
  Full line ranges in `mainwindow-refactor-review.md`.

- [ ] **[Refactor Phase 1c] Extract `WatchPanelPresenter`** *(Owner: Lyra Morn)*
  ~85 lines — smallest extraction candidate. Self-contained watch-panel sync logic.
  Good pattern-setter for the larger extractions that follow.

- [ ] **[Refactor Phase 1d] Quick XAML wins — constructor lambdas + SyncWatchPanel + ContextMenuOpening** *(Owner: Lyra Morn)*
  Three zero-risk code-behind cleanups identified in Lyra's XAML review:
  1. 650-line constructor packed with inline lambdas → extract to named event handlers (~200 lines)
  2. `SyncWatchPanel` Clear+loop+Add → `ItemsControl` + `DataTemplate` (~80 lines)
  3. `ContextMenuOpening` builds ContextMenu in C# → move to static XAML `<ContextMenu>` resource (~50 lines)

- [ ] **[Refactor Phase 2a] Extract `QueueTabController`** *(Owner: Lyra Morn)*
  ~1,600 lines — tab drag state machine, queue tab click handling, active-tab logic.
  Needs `_promptQueue` reference + a few UI callbacks. Medium risk.
  Full line ranges + dependency list in `mainwindow-refactor-review.md`.

- [ ] **[Refactor Phase 2b] Extract `AgentCardController`** *(Owner: Lyra Morn)*
  ~1,500 lines — agent card building, coloring, sync logic. References `_agents` collections.
  Coordinate with any concurrent AgentStatusCard changes. Medium risk.

- [ ] **[Refactor Phase 2c] Extract `RemoteAccessController`** *(Owner: Arjun Sen)*
  ~475 lines — RC-session state + bridge calls. Two divergent restart paths that should be unified
  as part of extraction. Arjun owns backend services; RC state is a backend concern.

- [ ] **[Refactor Phase 2d] Extract `DismissOnMovementHelper`** *(Owner: Lyra Morn)*
  Fade-popup dismiss-after-10px gesture duplicated in **5 places** in MainWindow.xaml.cs.
  Extract to a shared helper. Low-risk deduplication, high signal-to-noise.

- [ ] **[Refactor Phase 3a] Extract `DocsTreeController`** *(Owner: Lyra Morn)*
  ~2,500 lines — docs tree expand/rename/filter logic. Largest single LOC win.
  Well-clustered but moderate dependencies on workspace state. Medium risk.

- [ ] **[Refactor Phase 3b] Extract `ToolEntryPresenter`** *(Owner: Lyra Morn)*
  ~2,500 lines — tool-result card rendering, repeating `MakeItem`/`MakeSep` locals duplicated
  in 2+ context menu builders. High LOC win + deduplication. Medium risk.

- [ ] **[Refactor Phase 3c] Extract `DocScreenshotController`** *(Owner: Lyra Morn)*
  ~960 lines — screenshot attach/preview on docs panel. Needs `_pastedImageStore` reference.

- [ ] **[Refactor Phase 4] Extract `TranscriptPanelLayoutController`** *(Owner: Lyra Morn)*
  ~1,900 lines — layout/sizing logic for the transcript panel. Deeply entangled with
  `RichTextBox` visual tree. High risk — do last, after Phase 3 is complete and patterns
  are established. Do NOT start until Phase 3 is done.

---

## 🔵 Low Priority

- [ ] **OpenAI Whisper speech provider — customer request***(Owner: Orion Vale → Lyra Morn)*
  Customer request: support OpenAI speech API as an alternative to Azure Cognitive Speech, for users
  without an Azure subscription. Impact: ~5 modified files + 2 new files.
  Required changes:
  1. Extract `ISpeechRecognitionService` from `SpeechRecognitionService.cs` (events: `PhraseRecognized`, `VolumeChanged`, `RecognitionError`; methods: `StartAsync`, `StopAsync`, `WriteAudioData`)
  2. New `WhisperSpeechRecognitionService.cs` implementing that interface via OpenAI REST API
  3. `ApplicationSettingsSnapshot` + `ApplicationSettingsStore` — add `SpeechProvider` enum ("Azure" | "OpenAI")
  4. `PreferencesWindow.cs` — provider dropdown; show Whisper key field when OpenAI selected; hide Region field (not needed for Whisper)
  5. `MainWindow.xaml.cs` line 7641 — factory-create the right provider from settings
  6. `RemoteSpeechSession.cs` — use the interface (for RC phone PTT)
  Note: Whisper doesn't support phrase-list grammar hints — team name boosting silently becomes no-op for Whisper users.
  Note: Whisper is batch-oriented; streaming requires audio buffering — may have higher latency than Azure.



- [ ] **SubSquads — investigate and expose in UI** *(Owner: Orion Vale → Lyra Morn)*

- [ ] **[Vesper audit] Test coverage — screenshot infrastructure** *(Owner: Vesper Knox)*
  `ScreenshotRefreshRunner`, `ScreenshotNamingHelper`, and related fixture loaders have no unit
  tests. The refresh runner requires a WPF dispatcher — use integration-test seam or thin adapter
  pattern. Naming helper is pure logic and can be covered directly.

- [ ] **[Vesper audit] ScreenshotRefreshRunner — iterate light+dark variants** *(Owner: Vesper Knox)*
  `ScreenshotRefreshRunner.cs:172` has a TODO: "iterate twice for light+dark variants" but only
  one theme pass is currently executed. Implement dual-pass so screenshots are generated for both
  Light and Dark themes in the same refresh run.

- [ ] **Personal Squad — investigate and expose in UI** *(Owner: Orion Vale → Lyra Morn)*
  The `squad personal` feature was bridged (personal_list/personal_init) but the Workspace menu
  item was removed — it printed to transcript only with no visible feedback. Investigate what
  "personal squad" means in the current Squad SDK version (cross-workspace personal agents stored
  in the global Squad data dir), then design and implement useful UI if the feature has real value
  for SquadDash users.
