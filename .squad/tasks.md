## 🟡 Mid Priority

- [ ] **[Docking] Wire PanelDockingService into MainWindow layout** *(Owner: orion-vale)*
  Wire MovePanel() to actually move panel controls between Top/Left/Right container stacks. Define the three container elements in the main window Grid.

- [ ] **[Docking] Ctrl+click popup menu for panel relocation** *(Owner: orion-vale)*
  When the user Ctrl+clicks anywhere on a dockable panel, show a context menu with dock-target buttons (Top / Left / Right). Clicking instantly moves the panel via PanelDockingService.

- [ ] **[Docking] Named layout persistence per workspace** *(Owner: orion-vale)*
  Serialize/deserialize DockLayout to per-workspace settings. Allow save and recall by name. Wire to ApplicationSettingsStore or a dedicated layouts.json file.

- [ ] **[Docking] Panel docking UI spec** *(Owner: mira-quill)*
  Spec out the Ctrl+click popup UI — button layout, labels, visual affordances for each dock zone, keyboard shortcut (if any). To be done before the popup is implemented.

- [ ] **[Duplication] Investigate DUP-007— re-scan or re-examine original findings** *(Owner: Fred)*
  The original duplication scan (2026-05-21) identified DUP-001–010. Fixes were committed for
  DUP-001–006 and DUP-008–010. DUP-007 has no recorded fix and no description was persisted.
  Re-run the duplication scan (or examine git history from that session) to identify what DUP-007
  was and whether it still needs addressing.

- [ ] **[Routing] Add hard-coded argus-weld file-path guard in BuildStrongMatchRoutingInstruction** *(Owner: Arjun Sen)*
  Orion Vale architectural review (2026-05-24) identified that Argus Weld can be falsely triggered
  by any prompt mentioning a C# source file with "maintenance" in the name (e.g. MaintenanceRunner.cs).
  Fix: in SquadBridgePromptBuilder.BuildStrongMatchRoutingInstruction, add a hard-coded guard —
  if the candidate agent handle is "argus-weld", discard all matched signals unless at least one
  signal is a path starting with ".squad/maintenance" and ending with ".md".
  Must ship in the binary so it applies to ALL workspaces on upgrade.
  File: SquadDash/SquadBridgePromptBuilder.cs

- [ ] **[Routing] ADR — routing.md cannot express negative ownership signals** *(Owner: Mira Quill)*
  Orion Vale (2026-05-24) found a structural gap: ExtractOwnershipTokens harvests ALL backtick
  tokens as positive signals — no way to say "not this file" in the Examples column.
  Record as ADR in .squad/decisions.md. Orion's recommended option: a routing: file-pattern-only
  metadata field in team.md/charter that restricts strong-match to file-path signals only.

- [ ] **[Orion audit] `_isPromptRunning` — move ownership to PromptExecutionController** *(Owner: Arjun Sen)*
  `_isPromptRunning` is declared in MainWindow, mutated by PEC via setter delegate, read by
  `BackgroundTaskPresenter` via getter delegate, and read directly by MainWindow at 8 call sites.
  PEC is the natural owner (it sets the flag at prompt start/end). Consolidate ownership in PEC
  and expose it via a clean property rather than scattered delegates.

- [ ] **[Vesper audit] DocStatusStore — review silent catch blocks** *(Owner: Arjun Sen)*
  Vesper's audit flagged 34 bare catch blocks across the codebase; `DocStatusStore` in particular
  has silent failure suppression that may hide real errors. Review and replace with at minimum a
  `SquadDashTrace.Write` call so failures surface in the trace log.

## 🔴 High Priority


- [ ] **WinGet — smoke-test installer on clean VM** *(Owner: you — manual step)*
  Run `.\installer\build-installer.ps1 -Version 1.0.0` (requires Inno Setup 6 installed locally),
  then install on a clean Windows VM with only Node.js pre-installed. Verify: launcher starts,
  SDK bridge connects, workspaces resolve correctly from `%LocalAppData%\SquadDash\app\`.
  **Blocks:** GitHub Release, WinGet submission.

---

## 🔴 High Priority — Maintenance Mode (Phase 1 MVP)

> Feature: SquadDash enters "Maintenance Mode" after configurable idle time and executes tasks from `.squad/maintenance.md`.
> Phase 1 delivers the full backend pipeline end-to-end. Panel UI is Phase 2.


---

## 🟡 Mid Priority

- [ ] **Maintenance — custom task editor** *(Owner: Arjun Sen + Lyra Morn)*
  Right-click a task row → "Edit Task" opens a custom WPF editor window (code-only, no XAML).
  Layout: Title textbox (large font, top); Properties section (enabled, frequency, safety);
  UI Options section (YAML editor for `options:` block on left, live rendered preview on right);
  Instructions section (markdown preview on left, syntax-highlighted text editor on right with
  `{{variable}}` hover tooltips and `{{#if}}`/`{{/if}}` highlighting); Cancel + Save buttons.
  Both text editors support double-Ctrl voice dictation via `PttTextBoxAttachment`.
  Save writes back to the source maintenance file via `MaintenanceMdParser.UpdateTask()`.
  Requires adding `SourceFilePath` to `MaintenanceTask` record. Requires round-trip tests.
  **Prerequisite for:** Maintenance — multi-file support.

- [ ] **Maintenance — multi-file support** *(Owner: Arjun Sen + Lyra Morn)*
  Load all `maintenance*.md` files from the `.squad/` folder (e.g. `maintenance.md`,
  `maintenance-docs.md`, `maintenance-screenshots.md`). The base `maintenance.md` tasks are
  treated as "system" tasks. Additional files contribute supplemental tasks.
  Each task row in the panel must store its source file path so that toggle/frequency changes
  are written back to the correct file. Panel UI groups or labels tasks by source file.
  **Prerequisite for:** Inbox integration, per-repo custom maintenance tasks.


- [ ] **WinGet — create GitHub Release v1.0.0** *(Owner: you — manual step)*
  After smoke-test passes: create GitHub Release `v1.0.0`, attach the installer `.exe` and its
  SHA256 hash. The public download URL is required for `wingetcreate`.
  **Blocked by:** smoke-test passing.

- [ ] **WinGet — generate and submit manifest** *(Owner: Jae Min — automated once release exists)*
  Run `wingetcreate new <installer-url>`, add `OpenJS.NodeJS` as a `PackageDependencies` entry
  in the installer manifest YAML, open PR to `microsoft/winget-pkgs`.
  **Blocked by:** GitHub Release v1.0.0 existing with a stable download URL.


- [ ] **WinGet — Phase 2: release automation** *(Owner: Jae Min)*
  Create `.github/workflows/release.yml`: on `v*` tag push, run `dotnet publish`, bundle
  installer, upload to GitHub Release, run `wingetcreate update`, open PR to winget-pkgs
  automatically. Requires `WINGET_PKGS_PAT` repo secret.
  **Blocked by:** Phase 1 (manual release) succeeding at least once.

- [ ] **WinGet — write RELEASING.md runbook** *(Owner: Jae Min)*
  Document the full release checklist: bump version, tag, let automation run, verify winget PR.
  Include manual fallback steps. Useful for the first few releases before automation is trusted.

## 🟡 Mid Priority — Annotation Editor (Paste Image Window)

- [ ] **[Annot #1] Shift-click multi-drop mode indicator** *(Owner: Lyra Morn)*
  When arrow or rectangle button is shift-clicked to enter multi-drop mode, show a rounded-rect
  underline beneath the active button (same style as document chips / orientation buttons).
  Update tooltip/hover hint to say "Shift+click to drop multiples in a row". Update docs.

- [ ] **[Annot #2] Bug: double undo for each rectangle in shift-click mode** *(Owner: Lyra Morn)*
  Each rectangle dropped in shift-click multi-drop mode adds 2 undo entries instead of 1.
  Dropping 3 rectangles requires 6 Ctrl+Z presses. Not observed for arrows. Find duplicate push
  to the undo stack in the rectangle placement path and remove it.

- [ ] **[Annot #3] Arrow drag: origin point too close to arrowhead** *(Owner: Lyra Morn)*
  When click-dragging to place an arrow, the drag origin starts too close to the tip.
  At minimum double the initial drag distance so the arrow has meaningful length on first drag.

- [ ] **[Annot #4] Enter key crops to crop rectangle + undo + window resize** *(Owner: Lyra Morn)*
  When the crop rectangle is visible and the user presses Enter:
  - Crop the image to the rectangle bounds
  - Resize the annotation window to fit the new (smaller) image
  - Push a full undo entry so Ctrl+Z restores the full image + window size
  - After cropping, user should be able to zoom (Ctrl+wheel) and annotate the smaller region

- [ ] **[Annot #5] Text annotation tool (T button)** *(Owner: Lyra Morn)*
  New toolbar button "T". On click, user draws a rectangle on the canvas. That rectangle becomes
  a text annotation box with: flashing I-beam caret, character entry + paste + backspace/delete,
  word-wrap within box, auto-shrink font to fit (min 12pt Calibri), drag handles to resize/reposition,
  Shift+Enter for newline, Enter to deselect. Font: Calibri ≥12pt (OCR-legible).

- [ ] **[Annot #6] Bug: mouse cursor drop tool — nothing happens on click** *(Owner: Lyra Morn)*
  After using arrow tool, clicking the "drop cursor" tool does nothing. Likely a tool-state
  machine bug — tool mode may not be resetting correctly when switching from arrow to cursor tool.
  Investigate state transitions between annotation tool modes.

- [ ] **[Annot #7] Cropping tool cursor (Photoshop-style)** *(Owner: Lyra Morn)*
  When the crop tool / default crop state is active, show a Photoshop-style crop cursor
  (overlapping rectangles / corner brackets). Add to AnnotationCursors class.

- [ ] **[Annot #8] Drop mouse-cursor tool cursor: arrow + plus** *(Owner: Lyra Morn)*
  When the "drop mouse cursor" tool is active, the canvas cursor should show a mouse-arrow icon
  with a small plus/crosshair next to it (same pattern as arrow/rectangle tool cursors).
  The center of the crosshair is the hotspot. Add to AnnotationCursors class.

- [ ] **[Annot #9] Attach Image + Cancel buttons — move to far right** *(Owner: Lyra Morn)*
  Reposition the Attach Image and Cancel buttons to be right-aligned in the toolbar/footer bar.

## 🟡 Mid Priority — MainWindow.xaml.cs Refactoring

> Tracked from Orion + Lyra review (2026-05-19). Full details in session files.
> Full report: `mainwindow-refactor-review.md` (Orion) + `mainwindow-xaml-review.md` (Lyra).
> Current file: ~28,687 lines. Goal: extract cohesive domains into separate classes.

- [ ] **[Refactor Phase 1a] Extract `TranscriptSearchController`** *(Owner: Lyra Morn)*
  ~930 lines of transcript search logic (find-in-transcript, Shift+F3 cycling, highlight adorner
  management). `SearchWalker` is already embedded. Minimal `this` dependencies — easy to inject
  via constructor. Fixes the Shift+F3 duplication that currently exists in 2 separate search paths.
  Full line ranges in `mainwindow-refactor-review.md`.

- [ ] **[Refactor Phase 1b] Extract `PromptKeyboardController`** *(Owner: Lyra Morn)*
  ~700 lines of KeyDown/KeyUp handlers for the prompt input area. Pure input routing with no deep
  WPF visual-tree dependencies. Easy to inject Dispatcher + action callbacks.
  Full line ranges in `mainwindow-refactor-review.md`.

- [ ] **[Refactor Phase 1c] Extract `WatchPanelPresenter`** *(Owner: Lyra Morn)*
  ~85 lines — smallest extraction candidate. Self-contained watch-panel sync logic.
  Good pattern-setter for the larger extractions that follow.

- [ ] **[Refactor Phase 1d] Quick XAML wins — constructor lambdas + SyncWatchPanel + ContextMenuOpening** *(Owner: Lyra Morn)*
  Three zero-risk code-behind cleanups identified in Lyra's XAML review:
  1. 650-line constructor packed with inline lambdas → extract to named event handlers (~200 lines)
  2. `SyncWatchPanel` Clear+loop+Add → `ItemsControl` + `DataTemplate` (~80 lines)
  3. `ContextMenuOpening` builds ContextMenu in C# → move to static XAML `<ContextMenu>` resource (~50 lines)

- [ ] **[Refactor Phase 2a] Extract `QueueTabController`** *(Owner: Lyra Morn)*
  ~1,600 lines — tab drag state machine, queue tab click handling, active-tab logic.
  Needs `_promptQueue` reference + a few UI callbacks. Medium risk.
  Full line ranges + dependency list in `mainwindow-refactor-review.md`.

- [ ] **[Refactor Phase 2b] Extract `AgentCardController`** *(Owner: Lyra Morn)*
  ~1,500 lines — agent card building, coloring, sync logic. References `_agents` collections.
  Coordinate with any concurrent AgentStatusCard changes. Medium risk.

- [ ] **[Refactor Phase 2c] Extract `RemoteAccessController`** *(Owner: Arjun Sen)*
  ~475 lines — RC-session state + bridge calls. Two divergent restart paths that should be unified
  as part of extraction. Arjun owns backend services; RC state is a backend concern.

- [ ] **[Refactor Phase 2d] Extract `DismissOnMovementHelper`** *(Owner: Lyra Morn)*
  Fade-popup dismiss-after-10px gesture duplicated in **5 places** in MainWindow.xaml.cs.
  Extract to a shared helper. Low-risk deduplication, high signal-to-noise.

- [ ] **[Refactor Phase 3a] Extract `DocsTreeController`** *(Owner: Lyra Morn)*
  ~2,500 lines — docs tree expand/rename/filter logic. Largest single LOC win.
  Well-clustered but moderate dependencies on workspace state. Medium risk.

- [ ] **[Refactor Phase 3b] Extract `ToolEntryPresenter`** *(Owner: Lyra Morn)*
  ~2,500 lines — tool-result card rendering, repeating `MakeItem`/`MakeSep` locals duplicated
  in 2+ context menu builders. High LOC win + deduplication. Medium risk.

- [ ] **[Refactor Phase 3c] Extract `DocScreenshotController`** *(Owner: Lyra Morn)*
  ~960 lines — screenshot attach/preview on docs panel. Needs `_pastedImageStore` reference.

- [ ] **[Refactor Phase 4] Extract `TranscriptPanelLayoutController`** *(Owner: Lyra Morn)*
  ~1,900 lines — layout/sizing logic for the transcript panel. Deeply entangled with
  `RichTextBox` visual tree. High risk — do last, after Phase 3 is complete and patterns
  are established. Do NOT start until Phase 3 is done.

## 🟡 Mid Priority — Maintenance Mode (Phase 2 Enrichment)


---

## 🟡 Mid Priority — Maintenance Mode (Phase 3 Polish)

- [ ] **[Inbox] Inbox message save lost on shutdown — save INBOX_MESSAGE_JSON earlier** *(Owner: Lyra Morn)*
  INBOX_MESSAGE_JSON is currently saved in the `case "done":` bridge event handler. If the app shuts
  down while a turn is in-flight (streaming), the save never runs and the message is silently lost.
  Fix: save the inbox message as soon as the full response text is finalized (or at streaming end),
  not only on `bridge-done`. Consider a lightweight flush-on-close path that drains any pending
  INBOX_MESSAGE_JSON from the current response before shutdown completes.

- [ ] **[Maintenance] `branch`-safety tasks branch from current HEAD, not always from main** *(Owner: Arjun Sen)*
  When two `safety: branch` tasks run in a session, each task receives a prompt that says "create branch
  `maintenance/YYYYMMDD-<slug>` before making any code changes." The AI agent runs `git checkout -b`
  from whatever branch is currently checked out. Since task 1 commits to its branch and the runner does
  not switch back to main before task 2 starts, task 2 inherits task 1's commits on its new branch.
  Fix: `MaintenanceRunner` should record the base branch at session start (e.g. `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD`)
  and inject an explicit `git checkout <base-branch>` step into each `branch`-safety task's preamble
  before the `git checkout -b` instruction, so every task always branches from the same known base.

## 🟢 Low Priority — maintenance.md File Quality (Malik's Suggestions)

> These tasks clean up and improve the default `.squad/maintenance.md` file format and content.
> Run one at a time via the loop. S1, S3b, S4 require parser/UI changes; the rest are file-only edits.
> These tasks have a dependency order: do S1 first (new format), then S2/S3b/S4 against the new format,
> then S5/S6/S7/S8 as independent cleanup passes.

## 🔵 Low Priority

- [ ] **OpenAI Whisper speech provider — customer request***(Owner: Orion Vale → Lyra Morn)*
  Customer request: support OpenAI speech API as an alternative to Azure Cognitive Speech, for users
  without an Azure subscription. Impact: ~5 modified files + 2 new files.
  Required changes:
  1. Extract `ISpeechRecognitionService` from `SpeechRecognitionService.cs` (events: `PhraseRecognized`, `VolumeChanged`, `RecognitionError`; methods: `StartAsync`, `StopAsync`, `WriteAudioData`)
  2. New `WhisperSpeechRecognitionService.cs` implementing that interface via OpenAI REST API
  3. `ApplicationSettingsSnapshot` + `ApplicationSettingsStore` — add `SpeechProvider` enum ("Azure" | "OpenAI")
  4. `PreferencesWindow.cs` — provider dropdown; show Whisper key field when OpenAI selected; hide Region field (not needed for Whisper)
  5. `MainWindow.xaml.cs` line 7641 — factory-create the right provider from settings
  6. `RemoteSpeechSession.cs` — use the interface (for RC phone PTT)
  Note: Whisper doesn't support phrase-list grammar hints — team name boosting silently becomes no-op for Whisper users.
  Note: Whisper is batch-oriented; streaming requires audio buffering — may have higher latency than Azure.


- [ ] **SubSquads — investigate and expose in UI** *(Owner: Orion Vale → Lyra Morn)*

- [ ] **[Vesper audit] Test coverage — screenshot infrastructure** *(Owner: Vesper Knox)*
  `ScreenshotRefreshRunner`, `ScreenshotNamingHelper`, and related fixture loaders have no unit
  tests. The refresh runner requires a WPF dispatcher — use integration-test seam or thin adapter
  pattern. Naming helper is pure logic and can be covered directly.

- [ ] **[Vesper audit] ScreenshotRefreshRunner — iterate light+dark variants** *(Owner: Vesper Knox)*
  `ScreenshotRefreshRunner.cs:172` has a TODO: "iterate twice for light+dark variants" but only
  one theme pass is currently executed. Implement dual-pass so screenshots are generated for both
  Light and Dark themes in the same refresh run.

- [ ] **Personal Squad — investigate and expose in UI** *(Owner: Orion Vale → Lyra Morn)*
  The `squad personal` feature was bridged (personal_list/personal_init) but the Workspace menu
  item was removed — it printed to transcript only with no visible feedback. Investigate what
  "personal squad" means in the current Squad SDK version (cross-workspace personal agents stored
  in the global Squad data dir), then design and implement useful UI if the feature has real value
  for SquadDash users.
